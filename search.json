    "text": "Reduce the occurrence of sanitary sewer overflows to the bay\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nEncourage proper operation, maintenance and replacement of deteriorating and failing sanitary sewer infrastructure owned by utilities and private property owners. Encourage and support efforts to reduce groundwater and stormwater inflow and infiltration to sanitary sewer systems. Support local government capacity to gain adequate funding for needed capital improvement projects. Encourage communication, coordination and cooperation among regional utilities. Support public education and outreach about best practices for proper use and maintenance of privately-owned lateral sanitary sewer infrastructure (i.e., pipes connecting homes and businesses to municipal lines).\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Previously Action PH-1, this action is updated to incorporate new information about operation, maintenance and replacement of sanitary sewer infrastructure in the Tampa Bay watershed. It includes new information about efforts to improve communication, coordination and cooperation among regional utilities and a public education component.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSanitary sewer systems are closed, underground conveyances designed to collect and transport domestic, commercial and industrial wastewater to centralized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Occasionally, sanitary sewers can overflow and release untreated sewage into the environment — potentially contaminating surface waters and sediments and threatening public health. Reducing the occurrence of sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) is important to maintaining and improving water quality in Tampa Bay.\n\n\n\nSanitary sewer overflows may result in beaches being closed to swimming and fishing because of the potential for bacterial contamination. SOURCE: City of St. Petersburg\n\n\nSanitary sewers can overflow for a number of reasons, including improper design and capacity, aging infrastructure, line blockages and breaks, infiltration and inflow of stormwater, and equipment and power failures. Compound flooding from extreme rainfall events and sea level rise is projected to result in more frequent SSOs in the Tampa Bay watershed (Meyers et al. 2021). Addressing these challenges through proper operation and maintenance, capital improvement projects, education and enforcement will help reduce the incidence of sanitary sewer overflows.\nWhile initial design and construction problems can underlie some SSOs, it is more common for ongoing urban development to exceed original system capacity and lead to overflows. Solutions include retrofitting existing systems with additional pipes, bigger interceptors, reduced wet weather infiltration and inflow, more underground storage or additional WWTP treatment capacity.\nWastewater systems in the Tampa Bay area are showing their age. This is particularly true in older urban areas like the cities of St. Petersburg and Tampa. The City of Tampa launched the Progressive Infrastructure Planning to Ensure Stability (PIPES) program in 2017 with a goal to replace 20 miles of water lines and 30 miles of sewage pipes each year. Tampa also completed more than $15 million in maintenance projects at the Howard F. Curren Advanced WWTP. Another $36 M in facility improvements are either under construction, in design or planned. Elsewhere, Hillsborough County is retiring two aging WWTPs and consolidating treatment at the Northwest Regional Water Reclamation Facility to improve treatment efficiency and reduce power use.\n\n\n\nA sewer pipe clogged with fats, oils and greases.\n\n\nPipes can deteriorate and fail over time, especially those made from older, degradable materials like clay or Orangeburg — made of layers of wood pulp and pitch. For example, the volume of wastewater conveyed per person per day in Pinellas County is significantly higher in the South County system, where many pipes are made of vitrified clay, compared to the North County system, where the majority of pipes are made of PVC. This is likely due to the amount of infiltration and inflow entering via defects in the sanitary sewers. Between 2012 and 2015, Pinellas County completed 26 wastewater projects to reduce pollutant loading or SSOs at a cost of $7.6 M. Another seven projects totaling $16.4M are ongoing.\nThe City of Tampa has replaced pipes constructed of ductile iron that have failed due to corrosion, with new PVC pipes. Other infrastructure, including pumps, check valves and other moveable parts can also wear out, leading to mechanical failure. Older electric equipment or even lighting strikes can cause electrical failures at lift stations.\nBlockages can occur due to tree roots entering sanitary sewer systems through defects, breaks or cracks. They can also be caused by improper disposal of items into sanitary drains, including fats, oils and grease (FOG), baby wipes, new ‘flushable wipes’ and sanitary products. According to the City of Tampa, the number one cause of sewer overflows in the city is grease blockages. Tampa adopted a Grease Management Ordinance in 2006 to regulate the disposal of grease by grease haulers and food facilities. The city also provides outreach and education to the public about ways residents can keep improper items out of the sewer system.\n\n\n\nThis education campaign in Largo informs homeowners not to flush wipes, cotton pads, feminine products and other personal care products down toilets to reduce sewer overflows.\n\n\nBreaks and blockages can also contribute to added hydraulic stress on other parts of the system and produce a series of cascading failures down the line. Solutions to aging infrastructure and blockages include routine maintenance, cleaning and rehabilitation or replacement. A variety of leak detection technologies are available, including filling sections of pipe with smoke to help visualize breaks or using video cameras. There are newer, cheaper technologies (e.g., sonar) that can assist a utility in determining where to expend cleaning resources. Other “trenchless” technologies make repairs and rehabilitation easier, less expensive and cause less disturbance to the above-ground area.\nMany utilities in the Tampa Bay area have aggressive programs to replace older, deteriorating infrastructure. For example, Tampa invested $44 M to upgrade two master lift stations to improve wet-weather operations. Hillsborough Basin Management Action Plan (Hillsborough River Basin Working Group 2009; Florida Department of Environmental Protection 2016) participants committed to implement over 75 bacteria reduction projects, 45 of which were categorized as “wastewater infrastructure management” projects. Hillsborough County lined 214,000 feet of pipe with slip lining at a cost of $10 M, and the City of Largo invested $100 M for a new wet-weather force main. Pipes connecting homes and businesses to the municipal sewer system (private laterals) require similar attention, but are often neglected by property owners.\n\nHillsborough River Basin Working Group. 2009. “Hillsborough River Basin Management Action Plan for the Implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads - Adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in the Hillsborough River Basin for Fecal Coliform Bacteria.” Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Environmental Protection. https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/hillsb_bmap_adopted.pdf.\n\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection. 2016. “2015 Progress Report for the Hillsborough River Basin Management Action Plan.” Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Environmental Protection. https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/HillsboroughRiverBMAP-ProgRept2015.pdf.\n\nMarketing for Change. 2022. “Pipe Up: A Social Marketing Campaign to Reduce Nutrient and Bacteriological Pollution in Tampa Bay.” 05-22. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ClsjavjeUZgKuT56XScVYdnwXKX3_uOE/view?usp=sharing.\nTBEP launched the Pipe Up behavior change campaign in 2021 to encourage homeowners and homebuyers to inspect, repair, or replace aging private lateral sewer lines to prevent sanitary overflows into Tampa Bay and its watershed (Marketing for Change 2022). The campaign featured animated video and advertisements on Realtor.com, Facebook, and Instagram targeting home inspectors and homebuyers in the market for homes built before 1975. The next phase will continue in 2024.\nSanitary sewers in the Tampa Bay Area were not designed to transport groundwater and stormwater. Backups and overflows can occur when excessive amounts of groundwater and/or stormwater enter and overwhelm system capacity. This can result in sewage backups into homes, spills from manhole covers or lift stations or emergency discharges at WWTPs. Infiltration occurs when groundwater enters sanitary sewer systems through defective, permeable or broken pipes. Inflow occurs when stormwater enters the sanitary system through unauthorized connections (e.g., yard and roof drains, and submersible pumps). Sanitary sewer overflows due to inflow and infiltration are most commonly associated with rainstorms.\n\n\n\nHeavy rains can add large volumes of stormwater to sewer systems, causing them to overflow.\n\n\nFor example, unusually heavy rains in summer 2015 overwhelmed the City of St. Petersburg’s sanitary sewer system, and forced the city to discharge 31 million gallons of treated and untreated wastewater into Clam Bayou and Tampa Bay. The storm-related incident was compounded, in part, by loss of system capacity when the Albert Whitted WWTP was closed months earlier. Making matters worse, some homeowners associations, businesses and individual residents piped water out of flooded areas into the City’s sanitary sewers.\nIn retrospect, some overflows and releases due to the storm may have been avoidable if comprehensive system-wide action plans had been in place specifying emergency responses (similar to oil spill response plans), and if additional conveyance and storage capacity in neighboring utilities’ systems were made available. In Fall 2015, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) began convening regular meetings of regional utilities to improve communication, coordination and cooperation among them. One goal is to explore opportunities for cooperative resource and capacity-sharing among utilities during heavy storms or other emergencies.\nSolutions to reducing inflow and infiltration include regular inspection, rehabilitation and maintenance of broken, failing infrastructure. For example, leaky manhole covers can be made less susceptible to stormwater leaks by sealing them with manhole inserts. Rigorous construction inspections can assist in identifying and preventing illicit connections to sanitary sewer systems.\nThe City of St. Petersburg will invest more than $300 million in improvements to its wastewater treatment system through the year 2021 – including additional deep injection wells to dispose of treated wastewater during heavy rain events, expansion of the city’s three remaining WWTPs, and lining or sealing of targeted pipes and manholes.\nEquipment failures and lack of backup power can also cause overflows. Regular inspections and maintenance are important preventative measures. For example, Tampa installed emergency generators at some of its pump stations.\nClimate change will further strain aging wastewater infrastructure. Anticipated changes in storm intensity may escalate inflow and infiltration leading to more frequent sewer overflows and emergency releases. Rising sea levels and associated changes to groundwater may increase infiltration, corrode infrastructure and alter the effectiveness of wastewater treatment. As a result, climate change risks should be considered when planning new wastewater infrastructure. For example, planners may consider locating new wastewater treatment plants away from future surge and flood-prone areas and consider increasing capacity to accommodate anticipated increases in inflow and infiltration during more intense storms. Community resilience planning is underway in several municipalities in the bay watershed.\nThe University of South Florida developed a model to forecast the likelihood of future sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and help utility operators plan for future climate scenarios with intense storm events (Meyers et al. 2021). Researchers created an interactive dashboard to demonstrate SSO probabilities under both past and potential future conditions. Simulations suggest Tampa Bay can expect weather related SSOs an average of 5-7 days per year with a 0.5 m rise in sea level.\n\nMeyers, S. D., S. Landry, M. W. Beck, and M. E.

Develop nitrogen loading estimates for septic systems in the Tampa Bay area. Support adoption of new septic system nitrogen reduction technology and requirements for regular maintenance and inspection.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Local municipal partners have mapped septic systems and made progress extending central sewer and converting septic systems strategically and opportunistically with land development. The Basin Area Management Action Plan (BMAP) process has helped identify hotspots and develop strategies to reduce bacterial loading (see Action PH-4).\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOverall, bay-wide nitrogen loadings from septic systems are minor when compared to other sources, such as stormwater and air pollution (see Action WQ-1). A 1995 study estimated the total nitrogen loading to the bay from septic systems at 220 tons/yr, about 5% of the total (Ayres Associates 1995). A 2016 study of septic systems located within 200 meters of a waterbody within the ungaged basins of Tampa Bay estimated 4,666 septic systems contribute 40 tons of TN per year with 32% of the load flowing to Hillsborough Bay and 28% flowing to Manatee River (Janicki Environmental 2016).\n\nAyres Associates. 1995. “An Estimate of Nutrient Loadings from Wastewater Residuals Management and Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems in the Tampa Bay Watershed.” Brookesville, Florida: Southwest Florida Water Management District.\n\nJanicki Environmental. 2016. “Information Regarding the Effect of Removing on-Site Disposal Systems to Nutrient Loadings Rates.” Final Technical Memorandum TBNMC 2017 RA Update. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_tsGwwql-1z3cAsn8am-yRQ1pdfhXD6Q/view.\n\n\n\nExpansion of Hillsborough’s South County WWTP will allow treatment of 10 million gallons of wastewater daily — enough to accommodate growth in the area through 2025. SOURCE: Gresham Smith and Partners\n\n\nWhile nitrogen loading from septic systems is a concern, so are other chemicals including phosphates and “emerging contaminants” such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and microplastics (see Action COC-4), and bacterial pollution (see Action PH-4). Failed septic systems in residential or rural areas can contribute large numbers of coliform and other bacteria to surface and groundwater, especially in areas with large concentrations of older septic systems more prone to malfunctioning. Poorly maintained package plants (small privately owned wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are also of concern. Over the last decade, several of these have been closed and wastewater flow consolidated with larger, more efficient municipal WWTPs.\nBased on permit data from the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), there may be as many as 250,000 septic systems in the four coastal counties of the bay area, almost half built before 1970. For many years, new developments within Urban Service Areas have been required to hook up to central sewer, and expansion of Urban Service Areas over time has facilitated conversion of additional properties to central sewer. Even so, thousands of new permits for septic systems have been issued in the last decade. FDOH’s 2016 state-wide Florida Water Management Inventory (Ursin 2016) documents and maps the wastewater treatment method and the drinking water source for the more than 6 million improved parcels in the state. The study documented that in the three counties surrounding the bay, about 117,000 parcels have or likely have septic systems. This estimate does not include the portion of Pasco County within the bay watershed. More than half of all parcels in Pasco are on septic. Pinellas County has the fewest parcels served by septic systems (15,000 or 3.6%).\n\nUrsin, E. 2016. “Florida Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems Inventory: Final Project Report.” DEP Contract No. G0431. Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Health. https://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/onsite-sewage/research/_documents/rrac/10212016-draftfinalreportflwmi.pdf.\n\n\n\nLocations of known and estimated septic systems in the Tampa Bay Watershed. SOURCE: FDOH\n\n\nLocal government partners have basic inventories and maps of septic systems, and all have made good to substantial progress in converting septic systems to central sewer. Pinellas and Hillsborough counties and the cities of Clearwater, Largo, St. Petersburg, Tampa and Lakeland all have ongoing projects to convert more septic systems to central sewer as opportunities arise. Projects are tracked in the Action Plan Database of the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium (see Action WQ-1). Challenges remain with regard to central sewer expansion funding, cross-jurisdictional coordination, and delays in homeowner and businesses conversions due to costs and other factors.\nConversion from septic to sewer service can be costly, with residential hookup fees ranging anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 or more. This underscores the need for financing options such as interest-free loans and cost-sharing grants to assist residents who may have limited ability to pay. Additionally, availability of central sewer service may encourage higher density development in environmentally sensitive areas, an issue local governments must consider in their long-term planning. Without adequate user fees, local governments must bear the costs of additional operating capacity for their wastewater treatment plants.\nMeasures to address septic system sources of pollution have been developed through Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs). BMAPs identify various sources of potential pollution related to a specific Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), their relative contributions, additional research or monitoring needs and strategies to achieve TMDL reductions. Projects include high-probability septic system failure mapping (based on a number of criteria, including density, plat age, proximity to a water body, soil type and texture, seasonal high-water table, repair records and proximity to central sewer), microbial and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) source identification, septic system complaint response and septic system setbacks.\nWhile Florida law requires a 75-foot septic system setback from wells and surface waters, Manatee County implemented countywide requirements that mandate a 400-foot setback from waterways for new septic systems, encompassing freshwater, marine and tidal waters. If this setback is not feasible, then performance-based standards providing Advanced Wastewater Treatment (including additional nutrient removal capacity) must be achieved by the septic system. Hillsborough County also requires stricter setbacks as part of its wellfield protection buffers.\n\n\n\nA “passive nitrogen reduction” septic system utilizing bio-filters was installed and field-tested in 2015 at a residential site in Hillsborough County. SOURCE: Florida Department of Health\n\n\nIn 2015, FDOH completed the Florida Onsite Sewage Nitrogen Reduction Strategies Study, providing new methods and options for reducing nitrogen from septic systems in sensitive watersheds where sewers are not feasible. The seven-year project developed and field-tested new septic system designs, including system cost estimates and costs compared with existing systems. Systems were installed and tested at residential homes across the state, including a site in Hillsborough County.\nThe project also developed a nitrogen fate and transport model to estimate nitrogen contribution from septic systems in shallow aquifers. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) does not specifically quantify nitrogen loadings from septic tanks in overall watershed estimates; they are potentially captured as a part of non-point source and groundwater estimates. This is a future priority of the Nitrogen Management Consortium.\nAs of July 1, 2023, State legislation mandated that enhanced nutrient-reducing septic systems are required within watersheds with established nutrient TMDLs and BMAPs, and where central sewer service is unavailable. Regular inspections for septic systems near wells and surface waters remain an important issue to be addressed, potentially as initiatives arise as a result of the 2020 Clean Waterways Act, which transferred responsibility for implementing the Florida Statutes and regulations applicable to OSTDS to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\nLocally, city and county permits issued through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) offer a mechanism for addressing chronic failures of septic systems and package plants. Local Land Development Codes may also address problem areas with repeated failures of septic systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Reduce frequency and duration of harmful algal blooms\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to implement the Tampa Bay Nutrient Management Strategy to reduce the potential for harmful algal blooms (HABs) to occur or be exacerbated by excessive nutrient inputs. Support additional research on regionally occurring algal bloom species that have the potential to affect Tampa Bay. Continue education on the causes and effects of HABs in Tampa Bay.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nNew Action. Prior Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) contributions include: 1) funding an assessment of the distribution of cysts of the harmful algal bloom species Pyrodinium bahamense in Old Tampa Bay sediments (Karlen and Campbell 2012), 2) supporting a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) project through the Tampa Bay Environmental Restoration Fund to monitor the extent and duration of HABs and map algal biomass in surface waters of Old Tampa Bay and 3) developing an integrated ecosystem model in Old Tampa Bay to understand management actions that could reduce Pyrodinium blooms.\n\nKarlen, D. J., and K. Campbell. 2012. “The Distribution of Pyrodinium Bahamense Cysts in Old Tampa Bay Sediments.” 07-12. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RgHLp306QHzOgPmbq8HjGygnGaH9g2yt/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nA HAB is the proliferation of a toxic algal species that negatively affects natural resources or humans. Blooms occur when algae reproduce or accumulate at abundances much greater than normal for specific geographic areas. Because HABs can discolor water, they are sometimes referred to as ‘red tides’ or ‘brown tides’ depending on the algal species. However, this terminology can be confusing because HABs do not always discolor the water and discolored water may also be caused by non-harmful algal species or other phenomena.\n\n\n\nBlooms of a harmful algae called Pyrodinium bahamense have occurred in Old Tampa Bay every summer since 2000. SOURCE: Dorian Photography\n\n\nOccurrence of algal blooms is influenced by environmental factors — such as water temperature, light and nutrient availability, rainfall and water circulation — as well as biotic interactions such as competition with other algae and grazing by zooplankton and shellfish. HABs can negatively affect ecosystems by shading seagrasses, disrupting food webs and killing wildlife. High biomass blooms can contribute to the formation of low oxygen “dead-zones,” and some HAB species produce potent toxins harmful to people and marine life.\n\n\n\nFormation of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is a complex interaction of physical, biological and human factors that affect the timing and severity. SOURCE: A Primer on Gulf of Mexico harmful algal blooms, FWRI, FIO, MML, GOMA, GCOOS 2013\n\n\nSpecies associated with HABs in Tampa Bay include:\n\nCyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae), a photosynthetic bacteria nearly ubiquitous in marine and freshwaters. Some but not all cyanobacteria can produce a bright blue-green tint or slimy scum. Similarly, some but not all cyanobacteria are known to produce one or more biotoxins. Extensive blue-green algal blooms occurred in Tampa Bay in the 1970s and 1980s, associated with nutrient pollution from poorly treated wastewater. Blue-green algal blooms now occur mostly in nutrient-rich freshwater systems such as Lake Thonotosassa, although there has been a recent uptick in observation of the marine cyanobacteria Dapis pleousa. Preemptive measures to help prevent blue-green algal blooms in Tampa Bay focus on maintaining nutrient loading at target levels (see Action WQ-1).\nKarenia brevis (also known as Florida’s ‘red tide’ alga) is a single-celled dinoflagellate naturally occurring in marine and estuarine waters of Florida. Blooms develop 10-40 miles offshore, and are sometimes brought inshore by currents and winds. Although there is no direct link between coastal nutrient pollution and the initiation, frequency or severity of an offshore red tide bloom, nutrient runoff can help sustain blooms that are transported inshore. Red tide produces neurotoxins (brevetoxins) that can kill fish, seabirds, turtles and marine mammals; cause respiratory distress in people; and accumulate to dangerous levels in shellfish. Presently, there is no practical and acceptable way to control the formation of red tide blooms or remove the resulting toxins from the water.\nPyrodinium bahamense is also a naturally occurring dinoflagellate. It produces saxitoxins, which can accumulate in shellfish and cause poisoning if the shellfish are consumed. No closures of shellfish harvesting areas have been necessary in Tampa Bay to date, largely because no shellfish harvesting is allowed in Old Tampa Bay where blooms most frequently occur. Pyrodinium forms resting cysts that settle from the water column to sediments, forming a cyst bed to seed future blooms. There were no recorded occurrences of Pyrodinium in the bay between 1983 and 2000. However, blooms have occurred every summer since 2000 (Lopez et al. 2021). In the future, the intensity, timing and duration of Pyrodinium blooms may be influenced by increasing summer water temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns and corresponding changes in salinity and nutrient inputs. Additional research is needed to understand the factors associated with blooms of Pyrodinium and potential effective management actions.\n\n\nLopez, C. B., S. Shankar, S. G. Kaminski, M. Garrett, and K. A. Hubbard. 2021. “Linking Pyrodinium Bahamense Physiology and Behavior to Population Growth and Loss in Nature and Implications for Management.” 07a-21.

SOURCE: EPCHC\n\n\n\n\nThe extent and duration of some HABs can be mitigated by reducing nutrient pollution that fuels their growth. Although Tampa Bay meets water quality management goals in most years in most bay segments (see Action WQ-1), HABs occur regularly in Old Tampa Bay, a bay segment that inconsistently meets water quality targets. In particular, blooms of the potentially toxic dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense are occurring more frequently and for longer duration, with blooms occurring regularly since 2000. However, these blooms have yet to produce harmful ecological impacts — such as fish and shellfish toxicity resulting in large fish kills or widespread, low dissolved oxygen events. Therefore, they have been characterized as nuisance algal blooms. The factors that drive Pyrodinium blooms in Old Tampa Bay are not fully understood, but the formation of resting cysts and establishment of Pyrodinium resting cyst beds is important for bloom recurrence each year.\n\n\n\nLife cycle of the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense. SOURCE: FWC\n\n\nThrough a NOAA RESTORE Actionable Science grant, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) partnered with the TBEP to co-develop research initiatives that support decision making for actions that control dinoflagellate growth and improve water quality conditions supportive of longer-term seagrass recovery in Old Tampa Bay (Lopez et al. 2023). Potential management actions address cell growth as well as cell loss, such as causeway or flood control structure modifications that improve circulation and increase physical transport of algal cells out of Old Tampa Bay (Luther and Meyers 2022) and potential shellfish restoration projects that increase grazing rates on algal cells (Lopez et al. 2022).\n\nLopez, C.

Widespread “superblooms” in the lagoon since 2011, fueled in part by large volumes of nutrient-laden runoff, have caused a 60% loss of seagrasses, and unusually high mortality in fish, pelicans and manatees. Residents and tourism-dependent businesses have suffered the loss of key recreational resources for extended periods.\nThe environmental, economic, and social impact of the significant red tide event in 2017-2019 was documented retroactively through analysis of crowd-sourced information from the social media platform Twitter. An open science social media dashboard that is responsive to episodic HAB and spill events is under development. FWC maintains a toll-free Fish Kill Reporting Hotline and online reporting form and, in response to public concern, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) launched a similar toll-free Bloom Reporting Hotline and online reporting form for residents to report algal blooms.\nIn April 2021, harmful algae blooms resulted from an emergency release of ~215 million gallons of contaminated water into Tampa Bay from the aging phosphogypsum stacks of the former phosphate processing plant at Piney Point. TBEP coordinated the efforts of numerous partners to document, analyze, and communicate the bay’s response by developing an open science data portal for the community and researchers to make sense of the more than 12,000 data points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Expand adoption and implementation of Best Management Practices for commercial and urban agriculture\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nExpand utilization of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce nitrogen runoff to the bay. Target increased BMP participation from farms in priority areas where Total Maximum Daily Load regulations (TMDLs) or Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs) exist. Support regional cost-sharing programs for implementing BMPs. Expand education about best practices to community gardens and homeowners with vegetable gardens, backyard chickens, horses or livestock.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) has completed and adopted BMP manuals for every major commodity produced in the Tampa Bay watershed. Efforts to increase enrollment in FDACS BMP program are ongoing with outreach targeted to BMAP areas. Enrollment in the Hillsborough and Manatee BMAP areas is at or near 100%. FDACS and the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) have active cost-share programs to incentivize implementation of BMPs for commercial agriculture operations, while UF/IFAS provides educational materials and outreach on BMPs.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNon-point source pollutants from agriculture include nutrients from fertilizer and animal waste and pesticides. With improvements in irrigation and fertilization practices, public acquisition of former croplands and ongoing conversion of more intensive agricultural operations for commercial and residential development, nitrogen loading from agricultural sources has decreased in some areas in the Tampa Bay watershed. Some types of agriculture, such as cow/calf operations on pastures, may generate less nutrient runoff than residential development with highly maintained lawns. Urban agriculture (including community and backyard vegetable gardens and chicken coops) is increasing in popularity due to rising demand for homegrown and locally sourced foods.\n\nAgriculture is an important economic driver in the region — Hillsborough, Polk and Manatee counties are among the top 6 Florida counties in value of agricultural products sold. Based on 2017–2021 estimates from the Tampa Bay Estuary Program’s Nitrogen Management Consortium, agriculture accounts for about 20% (approximately 759 tons of the 3,959 tons per year average) of total nitrogen loading to the bay from nonpoint source runoff.\nBMPs can help farmers reduce impacts to soil and water resources while maintaining economically viable crop production levels. BMPs generally include a broad array of structural (e.g., constructed swales or basins) and non-structural (e.g., preservation or prevention) approaches to conserving water and reducing fertilizer and pesticide use. Many BMPs are also designed to protect nearby water resources.\nBMPs that have been verified and deemed effective at reducing pollutants by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) have been adopted by rule by FDACS for all major agricultural commodities produced in the Tampa Bay region. BMP manuals are reviewed at least every five years. FDACS recognizes that many smaller farms are ineligible for enrollment in the current FDACS BMP Program, and there are various livestock, such as goats, sheep, pigs, and emus, that are not covered by current manuals.\n\n\nFDACS Adopted BMP ManualsManualAdoptionRule ReferenceSilviculture20085I-6Sod20085M-9Cow/Calf20095M-11Specialty Fruit & Nut20115M-13Equine20125M-14Citrus20135M-16Nursery20145M-6Vegetable & Agronomic Crops20155M-8Aquaculture20155L-3Dairies20165M-17Poultry20165M-19\n\n\nCurrently, if there is no applicable BMP manual for their livestock, farmers with diversified farm operations alternatively may adopt an approved conservation plan tailored to their operation (Rule 5M-12 Conservation Plans for Specified Agricultural Operations). Notably, facilities with large numbers of livestock in a confined area, known as animal feeding operations (AFOs) and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), are not regulated by FDACS. Instead, FDEP regulates AFOs under its industrial wastewater rules and CAFOs under its NPDES program. Hobby farmers are not currently enrolled in the FDACS BMP Program; however, FDACS plans to develop and adopt manuals for these operations.\nAppropriate BMPs are encouraged through technical and financial assistance and a streamlined regulatory process. Farmers who implement FDACS-adopted BMPs benefit from a presumption of compliance with state water quality standards for pollutants that the BMPs address. Farming operations in BMAP areas are required to implement FDACS-adopted BMPs, otherwise they must conduct prescribed water quality monitoring that is approved by FDEP or Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) to demonstrate compliance with water quality standards. FDACS prioritizes outreach to commercial operators within BMAP areas. Producers who enroll in the FDACS BMP Program benefit from a presumption of compliance regardless of whether they are located within an adopted BMAP boundary. FDACS maintains a public mapviewer of BMP enrollment by commodity type.\nFDACS and SWFWMD incentivize adoption of BMPs through partnerships, such as the Facilitating Agricultural Resource Management Systems (FARMS) program that make it more feasible for farmers to implement new technologies. * The mini-FARMS program is a partnership of FDACS and SWFWMD that provides small farmers (less than 100 irrigated acres) reimbursement for 75% of the cost (up to $5000) to implement water conserving BMP projects. Farmers must be enrolled in the FDACS BMP Program to be eligible for mini-FARMS grants. SWFWMD offers the FARMS cost-share program for any farm located in the SWFWMD. * The Florida Farm Bureau County Alliance for Responsible Environmental Stewardship (CARES) program publicly recognizes farmers and ranchers that are enrolled with the FDACS BMP Program and remain in good standing with the FDACS Implementation Assurance Program. Producers receive a certificate and a “This Farm CARES” sign to place at their farm gate.\nIn 2014, FDACS’ Office of Agricultural Water Policy (OAWP) adopted a standardized statewide Implementation and Assurance Program consistent across all regions, commodities and BMP manuals. The program consists of two key components: mail-out surveys and site visits. Mail-out surveys are commodity specific and rotate between commodities year-to-year. The surveys contain a series of questions about management actions that correspond to the targeted BMPs for that commodity. Site visits utilize a standard form with inspections of BMP compliance for nutrient management, irrigation management and water resource protection.\nWith the passage of the Clean Waterways Act (2020), FDACS is expected to increase enrollment and inspections in BMAP areas statewide. As of 2022 within the three BMAP areas of TBEP (Alafia River, Hillsborough River, and Manatee River drainage areas), 15,089 out of 27,637 acres of agricultural lands were enrolled. Almost three-quarters of enrolled lands within BMAPs are cattle ranches. FDACS reports that 7,754 acres (644 parcels) of the remaining unenrolled lands are potentially enrollable. All except one of the required biennial site visits of agricultural operations within TBEP area BMAPs were completed between 2020-2022. Statewide, only two percent of inspection visits found the operations out of compliance with BMPs. The most common types of deficiencies involved record keeping, soil or tissue testing, or exceeding fertilizer application rates.\n\nUF/IFAS Extension Agents provide outreach to both commercial and non-commercial operators to encourage BMP adoption. Outreach to rural hobby operators (e.g., horse boarding facilities, alpaca ranches, rabbit breeding operations), especially with property adjacent to waterways, should be a focus. In addition, education should be extended to urban farmers with a greater potential to contribute pollution to stormwater runoff, including community gardens, backyard gardens and chicken coops.\nWith the growing popularity and interest among urban homeowners in backyard chicken coops, Pinellas County (and five of its municipalities), the City of Tampa, Polk County, and Manatee County have adopted backyard chicken ordinances. Some ordinances have setback requirements for the coop, which can help minimize stormwater pollution from waste. UF/IFAS is developing a Backyard Poultry 101 Workshop for Small Farms Agents in several counties, which will likely include recommendations for managing waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Reduce nitrogen runoff from urban landscapes\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to support and improve local fertilizer ordinances. Expand Best Management Practices (BMPs) certification programs for general landscape maintenance personnel. Explore incentives for homeowners to replace high-maintenance landscapes with lower maintenance alternatives. Expand outreach to homeowner and condo associations about statewide laws supporting water-conserving landscapes in deed-restricted communities and recommended changes to landscape covenants to comply with those laws. Continue research to quantify reduction in nitrogen loadings from reduced fertilizer use.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nThis action, formerly Action SW-12, has been merged with related Actions SW-1, SW-2, SW-3 and SW-11 to focus on the broader theme of reducing overall runoff from urban and residential landscapes.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nResidential fertilizer is a significant source of nitrogen to the bay, accounting for about 20% of the nitrogen carried in stormwater. The costs of treating stormwater from urban areas (estimated at $3,500 per pound of nitrogen removed, per the statewide Section 319h stormwater project database) led many bay area communities to adopt local fertilizer ordinances as a practical and cost-effective way to substantially reduce nitrogen inputs at little cost to taxpayers. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) was instrumental in the development and adoption of these city and county ordinances.\n\n\n\nLandscapes with reduced turfgrass conserve water and reduce runoff. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nMost of the ordinances prohibit use of nitrogen fertilizers from June 1-September 30, when the region receives 60% of its average annual rainfall and the potential for fertilizer runoff is greatest. They also require use of slow-release nitrogen fertilizers outside the summer rainy season to minimize nutrient leaching.\nOrdinances in Pinellas County (and all 24 municipalities within the County) and the City of Tampa ban both use and sales of nitrogen lawn and landscape fertilizers in the summer. The Hillsborough County and Manatee County ordinances restrict use of these products in the summer. The Pasco County ordinance mirrors a statewide model that prohibits fertilizer application when flood or storm watches are issued or likely, or when heavy rains are expected. Effectiveness of ordinances without sales restrictions could be enhanced by amendments to require stores where fertilizer is sold to post signs about the laws and to identify compliant products.\nTBEP led regional fertilizer education efforts at the request of its Policy Board. The resulting Be Floridian campaign utilized social marketing principles to promote compliance with summer fertilizer bans. The campaign capitalized on the importance of water-based recreation to bay residents, urging them to “skip the fertilizer in the summer” to protect the waters that make living here fun. It also encouraged homeowners to “Garden Like A Floridian” by replacing turfgrass with lower-maintenance plants.\n\n\n\nBillboards like this one along I-275 in St. Petersburg reminded residents to avoid use of fertilizer in the summer.\n\n\nOver a 5-year period, Be Floridian used billboards, print ads, digital ads, vehicle wraps, a resource-rich website, shareable infographics, an online pledge and targeted outreach at both community events and garden centers (including big box stores) that sell lawn care products. A dynamic social media presence was enhanced by the campaign’s plastic pink yard flamingo mascot. A traveling exhibit of yard flamingos painted by area artists toured museums, art centers, tourist attractions and an airport promoting the “Protect Our Fun” theme. More than 230,000 people viewed the unique artist-painted flock during its year-long tour of the region.\nEvaluations of Be Floridian showed that the campaign helped to boost knowledge of and compliance with the fertilizer ordinances. Fewer than 5% of respondents in a 2015 evaluation survey identified summer months as the best time to fertilize lawns, and 63% said they were less likely to use fertilizer in summer because of what they had learned (up from 47% in a 2012 survey). External social science surveys conducted as part of an overall evaluation of fertilizer practices and ordinance awareness also showed widespread awareness that fertilizer should not be applied before a heavy rain. That research also found that Pinellas County residents were more aware of fertilizer ordinances, and applied significantly less fertilizer to their lawns.\n\n\n\nPinellas County installed wraps on several fleet vehicles to promote pollution prevention.\n\n\nA variety of other educational programs continue to reinforce and expand outreach to homeowners, property managers and lawn care professionals. The longstanding Florida Yards & Neighborhoods Program (FY&N) administered by UF/IFAS Extension is delivered locally through county extension offices. The FY&N program promotes Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ to reduce water, fertilizer and pesticide use. Extension specialists also provide Best Management Practices training now required by state law for all commercial fertilizer applicators in Florida.\nAdditional training for general landscape maintenance personnel on key aspects of lawn care that influence water quality (such as management of grass clippings) is required in Pinellas and Manatee counties. That training is provided by county staff, but potentially could be expanded to additional counties and conducted by Extension specialists if funding were available.\nMore effort also should be directed to educating landscapers, irrigation contractors, homeowners, homeowner associations and property managers about reducing or eliminating fertilizer use where reclaimed water is used to irrigate lawns, since reclaimed water contains varying amounts of nutrients depending on source (see Action WW-1). Pinellas County developed a map-based fertilizer reduction tool for users to type in their address to learn the recommended fertilizer application rate based on the average nutrient concentration of the reuse irrigation water serving their property.\nHillsborough and Pinellas counties also offer Adopt A Pond programs that teach residents how to improve management of stormwater ponds at the neighborhood level – including creation of vegetated shoreline buffer zones and reduced fertilizer and chemical use on neighborhood lawns that drain to the ponds. A comprehensive social marketing-based program led by UF/IFAS is increasing awareness and action to improve stormwater pond management among residents of the sprawling Lakewood Ranch community in Manatee and Sarasota counties.\n\n\n\nA healthy neighborhood stormwater pond with a vegetated shoreline buffer and littoral zone. SOURCE: David Shafer\n\n\nDeed-restricted Homeowner Associations (HOAs) continue to be a major barrier to a shift in cultural norms toward less-lawn or no-lawn landscapes that require less water and fertilizer use. These barriers exist despite the passage of state laws allowing Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ in deed-restricted communities to conserve water. Court cases still have not clearly established a precedent that favors this law over HOA covenants, although some HOAs have updated their covenants and plant lists to allow more flexibility and integrate UF/IFAS recommendations for Florida-friendly plants.\nIncentives to conserve water and reduce high-maintenance turfgrass also are needed. One promising model is the new “Turf Swap” program in Alachua County. Starting in April 2017, the program will offer cash rebates to property owners that replace irrigated turf with Florida Friendly LandscapingTM.\n\n\n\nA variety of Florida native and adapted plants create a beautiful no mow yard that needs little to no irrigation or fertilizer. SOURCE: UF/IFAS Extension\n\n\nAs of 2017, Pinellas County has a UF/IFAS Extension specialist dedicated to working with HOAs, condo associations and property managers. Pasco County’s FY&N coordinator also has had success in working with HOAs, and all the FY&N county programs consistently provide high-quality training and free assistance to homeowners across their geographic and demographic spectrums. Future efforts to reduce nitrogen from urban landscapes in the Tampa Bay watershed must focus on reaching and recruiting these key audiences.\nAdditional research is needed to quantify the impact of fertilizer ordinances on water quality over time, and to improve ordinance compliance. A study coordinated by TBEP found that a minimum of 5-6 years of monitoring is needed to test for statistically significant differences in environmental data collected from Tampa Bay residential communities with different fertilizer ordinances (Listopad, Souto, and Bohlen 2015).\n\nListopad, C., L.

    "text": "Reduce fecal contamination from humans and pets in bay area waters\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nReduce pet and human waste fecal contamination in Tampa Bay Area waters designated Class III “fishable and swimmable.” Conduct research to better quantify sources of fecal contamination. Include strategies to address hot spots in these water segments in Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs). Expand waterborne fecal contamination monitoring to additional areas where people and pets congregate. Continue to educate the public about proper disposal of pet waste.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nAction moved and renamed from Public Access Action Plan (PA-1: Reduce Human and Pet Waste in Traditional Recreation Areas). Action expanded to encompass all Tampa Bay Area waters designated Class III “fishable and swimmable.” Focus placed on pet waste and direct human waste pollution.\nConsiderable progress has been made in addressing proper disposal of pet waste. Basin Management Action Plans have or will be adopted for bay waters designated as impaired for fecal coliforms, with specific strategies focused on reducing fecal coliform pollution. More information is needed to quantify whether and to what extent fecal contamination associated with recreational areas lacking restroom facilities, or from homeless populations in urban centers, is a problem.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTampa Bay supports a wide range of aquatic recreational activities, including boating, fishing, swimming, and paddle-boarding. The health of Tampa Bay’s waters is linked to our region’s economy, environment and quality of life. Fecal contamination of waterways can contribute bacteria, viruses and parasites that cause a variety of illnesses ranging from rashes, infections and diarrhea to more serious and life-threatening conditions.\n\n\n\nThe shoreline on the western side of the Gandy Bridge is a traditional recreational area without restroom facilities. SOURCE: Tampa Tribune\n\n\nMany bay waters and tributaries experience fecal contamination periodically from a variety of sources, including sewer overflows, wildlife, domestic livestock, pets and humans. Potential problem areas include recreational areas without restroom facilities, marinas and mooring fields where discharges of waste from liveaboard boaters may occur (see Action PH-5) or urban waterfronts with large homeless populations.\nFecal matter from feral or free-roaming cats, or urban livestock may be a local or seasonal contributor (e.g., horse manure generated during racing season at Tampa Bay Downs). However, little is known about the magnitude of these localized impacts; overall, bacterial levels in waste from these animals are lower than for dogs or humans. Farms and ranches in the upper parts of the watershed can be sources of fecal contamination in more rural areas of the watershed, as well as backyard chicken coops in urban areas (see Action SW-8).\nSewer overflows are addressed elsewhere in this Plan (see Actions WW-3 and WW-5), as is monitoring of formal swimming beaches by area health departments (see Action PH-2) and pollution from liveaboard boaters (see Action PH-5). This action focuses on pet waste and human waste stemming from unregulated or underserved waterways in the bay watershed.\nSeveral traditional recreational areas along the bay, including the Courtney Campbell Causeway, the Gandy Causeway in northern St. Petersburg and the Pinellas Bayway, are enjoyed by thousands of people and their pets year-round. However, most of these traditional-use beach playgrounds lack bathroom facilities, and bacterial water contamination may result from human or dog waste in specific, localized areas. Funding and ongoing management of these areas remains a challenge for local governments with limited resources.\nMost surface waters in Florida are categorized as Class III waters, meaning they should be “fishable and swimmable” and support the propagation and maintenance of healthy, well-balanced populations of fish and wildlife. Under the Clean Water Act, states are required every two years to identify impaired waters that do not meet their designated uses, including those that exceed fecal coliform standards. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) develops a list of impaired waters in Florida and adopts Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) for priority waterbody segments it identifies as impaired. A TMDL is the maximum amount of an identified pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate while maintaining its designated uses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of Tampa Bay area watershed basins with bacterial impairments. SOURCE: FDEP\n\n\n\n\nThe Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) and its partners assisted FDEP in creating comprehensive Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs) for major portions of the Hillsborough, Alafia and Manatee Rivers impaired by fecal contamination. BMAPs present locally-specific strategies to reduce pollutant loadings to levels below established TMDLs, including identifying and assessing the relative contributions of bacterial loadings from sources within a watershed, or watershed segment.\nBMAPs identify projects in the following categories: Agricultural BMPs; Restoration and Water Quality Improvement Projects; Regulations, Ordinances, and Guidelines; Education and Outreach Efforts; Basic Stormwater Management Program Implementation; Wastewater Infrastructure Management, Maintenance Repair, and Upgrade; Special Studies, Planning, Monitoring, and Assessment.\nThe Hillsborough River BMAP (Hillsborough River Basin Working Group 2009) was developed by FDEP in collaboration with TBEP; Hillsborough, Pasco and Polk Counties; the Cities of Plant City, Tampa, and Temple Terrace; the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County and Hillsborough County Health Department; the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Florida Department of Transportation, the Southwest Florida Water Management District and the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.\n\nHillsborough River Basin Working Group. 2009. “Hillsborough River Basin Management Action Plan for the Implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads - Adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in the Hillsborough River Basin for Fecal Coliform Bacteria.” Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Environmental Protection. https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/hillsb_bmap_adopted.pdf.\nAll surface waters in the Hillsborough River Basin are designated as Class III waters, with portions above the Hillsborough River Dam designated as Class 1 (potable water) and an Outstanding Florida Water. The Hillsborough River BMAP identified management strategies necessary to achieve the fecal coliform TMDLs for six stream segments: Blackwater Creek, New River, Sparkman Branch, Baker Creek, Flint Creek and the Lower Hillsborough River.\nThe BMAP process in other urban areas has identified homeless populations as a potential contributor to fecal contamination. This possibility was discussed during development of the Hillsborough River BMAP; research is needed to quantify and address this sensitive issue. Since BMAP implementation in 2009, fecal coliform levels (an indicator of fecal contamination) have generally improved in all the Hillsborough River sub-basins (Sherwood and Morrison 2013). TBEP has developed an open science workflow to download EPC FIB data, analyze the results, and create summary maps or plots.\n\nSherwood, E., and G. Morrison. 2013. “Hillsborough River Fecal Coliform BMAP Update (2013).” 05-13. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MZnK3cMzV7LRg6dTbCKX8AOZU0GNurJJ/view?usp=drivesdk.\nThe Alafia River BMAP (2014) is a collaborative ef­fort developed by FDEP with area-wide stakeholders, TBEP and the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium. This BMAP addresses four water body segments impaired for fecal coliform contamination: Turkey Creek, Mustang Ranch Creek, English Creek and Poley Creek.\nThe Manatee River BMAP (2014) is a collaborative effort devel­oped by FDEP with area-wide stakeholders, TBEP and the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium. This BMAP addresses four waterbody segments impaired for fecal coliform contamination: Rattlesnake Slough, Cedar Creek, Nonsense Creek and Braden River above Evers Reservoir.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay has numerous dog-friendly beaches.\n\n\nTBEP’s Pooches for the Planet pet waste education campaign, launched in 2006, has helped focus regional attention on a significant source of fecal coliform for which prevention is a cost-effective and simple solution.\nNumerous studies have shown that pet waste is a significant contributor to bacterial loadings in urban stormwater. The approximately 500,000 dogs in the bay watershed produce about 125 tons of waste daily. Surveys have shown that about 40% of dog owners do not pick up after their pets, meaning 45 tons is left unscooped. This dog waste is carried by stormwater to the closest waterway. Just one ounce of dog feces contains 23 million bacteria — nearly twice that of human waste.\nPooches for the Planet applied social marketing principles to encourage dog owners to pick up and properly dispose of their dog’s waste. Elements included:\n\nGPS mapping of dog poop piles prior to and following pet waste education. Three participating neighborhoods demonstrated an average 85.5% reduction in the number of dog poop piles left on the ground in waterfront parks in their communities.\nEye-catching signs posted at riverfront and bayfront parks in Tampa and Manatee County, and at all dog parks in Pinellas County. Signs and pet waste stations were posted at nine neighborhood or regional parks in St. Petersburg.\n“Scoop That Poop” informational posters, rack cards and business-sized “Scoop That Poop” pledge cards distributed to more than 500 veterinary clinics in the 3-county area.\nA 60-second video PSA about the importance of proper pet waste disposal.\nMore than 1,000 “Scoop That Poop” door hangers distributed as part of a pilot project in three neighborhoods in St. Petersburg. An additional 5,000 door hangers have been distributed by request to area neighborhoods, condos and apartment complexes.\n1,800 free Pooches for the Planet adoption kits distributed through county and humane society animal shelters in Manatee and Pinellas counties. The kits contained pet waste bag dispensers, a pet waste cartoon CD, and a listing of county dog parks, along with toys, treats and discount coupons for pet supplies and services. More than 90% of the respondents in a follow-up survey indicated they properly dispose of their dog’s waste.\n\n\n\n\nAn information station at Rivercrest Park in Tampa was part of TEBP’s Pooches for the Planet pet waste education campaign.\n\n\nSignificant pet waste educational programming also was sponsored by the Southwest Florida Water Management District, and implemented by the Keep America Beautiful affiliates in the area. Pet waste education is now a regular part of environmental education in the Tampa Bay region, and pet waste bag stations are installed and maintained at all area dog parks and dog beaches, as well as many other city and county parks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Identify and understand emerging contaminants\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nIdentify sources and understand impacts of contaminants found in pharmaceuticals, personal care products and microplastics. Promote education to reduce pollution from microplastics and emerging contaminants.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nNew Action\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAquatic environments are the ultimate reservoirs for many man-made chemical contaminants. The toxicity of pesticides and industrial chemicals, such as DDT, chlordane, dieldrin and PCBs, is well documented and their use banned or discontinued decades ago. Nevertheless, they persist in aquatic sediments and bioaccumulate in fish and wildlife in Tampa Bay (see Action COC-1).\n\n\n\nStudents from Eckerd College collect water samples to analyze for microplastics. SOURCE: David Hastings\n\n\nThe presence and potential effects of synthetic or natural endocrine or hormone disruptors is an emerging concern for fish and wildlife, as well as human health in Tampa Bay. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) mimic the functions of natural hormones, affecting growth, reproduction and development in aquatic organisms, especially fish. They include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs — used as a flame retardant in clothing, furniture and electronics), perfluorinated and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and bisphenol A (BPA — used to make plastic), which can be acutely toxic to fish and wildlife. Even at low levels these compounds can disrupt hormonal systems over time. Another class of EDCs comes from ethinyl estradiol — a synthetic estrogen used in oral contraceptives — which has been found in aquatic environments downstream of wastewater treatment plants. EDCs are also found in pesticides, insecticides and fungicides.\nAdditionally, a wide variety of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) — including lotions, shampoos, sunscreens, perfumes and cosmetics — contain constituents such as phthalates, parabens, glycol ethers, ultraviolet (UV) filters, polycyclic musks and antimicrobials, that have been linked to adverse endocrine or reproductive effects. Research has documented the presence of these chemical compounds in municipal waste effluent.\nLocally, a 2015 University of South Florida study quantified six estrogen-based EDCs in Tampa Bay Area water, sediment, and sewage influent and effluent (Cook 2015). All targeted EDCs were present in 89% of sewage from sewer plant discharge samples, while 100% of the samples contained at least one or more EDCs. The concentrations of EDCs in water and sediment samples tended to decrease with increasing distance from the wastewater treatment plant discharge site. At present, however, there is great uncertainty surrounding actionable levels of EDCs, and current toxicity testing required of chemical products does not evaluate endocrine-disrupting effects.\n\nCook, M. M. 2015. “Endocrine-Disrupting Compounds: Measurement in Tampa Bay, Removal from Sewage and Development of an Estrogen Receptor Model.” PhD thesis, St. Petersburg, Florida: University of South Florida.\n\nPulster, E. L., K. Rullo, S. Gilbert, T. M. Ash, B. Goetting, K. Campbell, S. A. Markham, and S. A. Murawski. 2022. “Assessing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Sediments and Fishes in a Large, Urbanized Estuary and the Potential Human Health Implications.” Frontiers in Marine Science 9 (11-22): 16. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1046667.\nA 2022 study quantified per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in sediments and fish of Tampa Bay and found levels exceeding concentration thresholds for minimum risk levels (Pulster et al. 2022). In a 2023 redfish pharmaceuticals contamination study across nine Florida estuaries conducted by Bonefish Tarpon Trust and FIU, researchers detected 17 unique pharmaceuticals in fish blood plasma. Tampa Bay redfish had on average three different pharmaceuticals, the second highest occurrence in the state. As wastewater infrastructure is updated and upgraded (see WW-5), research is needed to assess the efficacy of various wastewater treatment technologies at removing these contaminants prior to discharge or reuse and to evaluate the ecological and human health implications of indirect reuse to augment groundwater or surface water supplies in the Tampa Bay area.\nMicroplastics are another emerging contaminant of concern in Tampa Bay. Generally between 1-5 millimeters in size, microplastics are small plastic particles usually derived from the breakdown of larger plastic marine debris. Another source is from the direct manufacture of microbeads, such as those found in cleansers and cosmetics. A 2015 Federal Law bans the addition of microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics by July 2017. In Tampa Bay, plastic fragments, including from tire wear, are the most common type of plastic particles (Gowans and Suida 2020). Microbeads and fibers are often too small to be filtered out by most wastewater treatment systems, and are released into the environment with treated wastewater.\n\n\n\nPlastic microbeads in facial scrub. SOURCE: Dave Graft\n\n\nSlow to break down, plastics persist in surface waters and throughout the water column and can become incorporated into organisms and sediments. Fibers can also absorb chemical contaminants and become laden with toxins. Microplastics have been found embedded in the tissue of worms, crustaceans, sea cucumbers and fish through ingestion or respiration and can accumulate in the stomachs of predators. Thus, fish and wildlife can be harmed by physical blockage or damage to the digestive tract, leaching of plastic chemical components into tissues and ingestion and accumulation of toxins adsorbed to the plastic (such as metals, PCBs and PBDEs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n90% of coastal water samples in Florida contain at least one piece of plastic.\n\n\nResearch on the presence of microplastics in Tampa Bay shows an abundance of plastic fragments, with highest concentrations found in Old Tampa Bay and Lower Tampa Bay, near Egmont Key. A TBERF-funded project with Eckerd College standardized methods for collecting, identifying and quantifying microplastics in the environment with specific findings on the abundance, distribution, and ecological interactions of microplastics in Tampa Bay (Gowans and Suida 2020). More information is needed to better understand how microplastics enter waterways, how they are distributed, and what impacts they may have on aquatic organisms.\n\nGowans, S., and A. Suida. 2020. “Microplastics in Tampa Bay: Abundance, Distribution, and Ecological Interactions (2018 TBERF).” 04-21. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/13vFupgf-2DJNHeV2k1j7Lg2FQnaCgell/view?usp=sharing.\nMicroplastics could be sampled as part of monthly water quality sampling for Tampa Bay conducted by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC). Fish tissue samples could be collected to evaluate the presence, types and ecological impacts of microplastics as part of fisheries-independent sampling conducted by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) (see Action FW-5).\n\n\n\nParticipants in a community science workshop learn how to identify and document the presence of microplastics in bay water samples.\n\n\nThe statewide Florida Microplastic Awareness Project, funded by a 2015 NOAA Marine Debris Grant, seeks to train citizen scientists to collect and analyze water samples for microplastics. An important goal of this project is to increase public awareness of how plastics in local waterways are connected to human sources. The program also includes an online pledge for actions that can reduce plastic marine debris. Training workshops using the filtered water sample method were held by Pinellas County UF/IFAS Extension in 2016 and 2017, including training for the UF/IFAS Florida Water Stewardship Program and a Pinellas County-wide workshop on litter. The Florida Aquarium is also a project partner.\nWith an award of EPA’s Trash Free Waters grant in 2019, TBEP and partners deployed and maintained 12 trash capture devices within the Tampa Bay watershed. At each site, project partners regularly clean out captured trash and record the unique characteristics of the debris. The data will be used to help identify the sources and develop a litter management plan template for Tampa Bay and other Gulf of Mexico estuaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Continue to reduce nitrogen loading from atmospheric deposition\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to support power plant upgrades and transitions to alternate energy sources. Continue to support initiatives to reduce atmospheric nitrogen pollution from vehicles. Expand the number of air monitoring stations for atmospheric nitrogen. Support research to better understand and quantify the contribution of atmospheric deposition to stormwater runoff. Support public education about the link between air and water quality.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nRevised Action. Formerly Action AD-1 Continue atmospheric deposition studies to better understand the relationship between air and water quality. Appended with background from former Action AD-2 Promote public and business energy conservation.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nReducing nitrogen input (loading) to Tampa Bay is a core management objective for the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) and its partners (see Action WQ-1). Reductions in nitrogen pollution are linked to improved water quality, recovery of seagrass meadows and associated marine life and other environmental and human health benefits.\n\n\n\nTECO’s 23-megawatt solar array near the Big Bend Power Station is capable of powering more than 3,300 homes. SOURCE: Tampa Electric\n\n\nNitrogen (N) pollution can reach Tampa Bay from a variety of sources, including stormwater runoff from non-point sources (e.g., urban fertilizer runoff or septic systems — see Actions SW-1, SW-8, SW-10, WW-2), point sources (e.g., a wastewater treatment plant — see Actions WW-3 and WW-5), groundwater and springs and atmospheric deposition. Atmospheric nitrogen can reach bay waters directly through deposition from rainfall and dust and indirectly through stormwater runoff carrying atmospheric nitrogen deposited on impervious surfaces in the watershed.\nNitrogen can be emitted to the atmosphere from natural sources, such as manure emissions, forest fires and lightning. In Tampa Bay’s highly urbanized watershed, natural sources are a relatively small contributor to atmospheric nitrogen loading. Most atmospheric nitrogen is emitted from fossil-fuel burning power plants and vehicles.\nTBEP has been a national leader in investigating and quantifying the significant role of airborne nitrogen in overall nitrogen inputs to the bay. The long-term, multi-site bay Region Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (BRACE), completed in 2013, was conducted by scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), University of South Florida, TBEP and other federal, state and local environmental agencies.\nBRACE demonstrated that atmospheric deposition (both directly on the bay’s surface, and indirectly, through stormwater runoff) accounted for 57% of the total annual nitrogen loading to the bay from all sources. This contribution is mainly in the form of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to ozone, an air pollutant of public health concern in Florida. BRACE showed that atmospheric sources contributed four times as much nitrogen to Tampa Bay as discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants and industry combined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the bulk of emissions generated in the Tampa Bay Area originated from power plants and industry, BRACE demonstrated that emissions from vehicles had a larger local impact. This is likely due to the fact that these emissions are generated low to the ground and tend to stay within the bay watershed, while pollution emitted from tall industrial stacks is dispersed over a much larger airshed that extends north to Atlanta and south to Cuba.\nData collected for BRACE showed that, compared to power plants, vehicles contributed four times more NOx deposition to the Tampa Bay watershed and two times more NOx deposition directly to the bay. The study also reported that two-thirds of atmospheric nitrogen deposition was contained in dust particles (dry deposition) and one-third came with rainfall (wet deposition); and that air pollution from outside the Tampa Bay Area can impact the bay as well.\n\nAn ongoing University of Florida research and IFAS/Extension project aims to better understand and publicly communicate the contribution of atmospheric deposition to N loads in stormwater. The study looks at the potential impact of atmospherically derived N on water quality in the Tampa Bay watershed as it interacts with the urban tree canopy and urban impervious surfaces. Further, researchers are studying how atmospheric N may be utilized by Karenia brevis and Pyrodinium bahamense, the toxic microalgae most responsible for algal problems in Tampa Bay.\nLocal and national regulations are significantly reducing nitrogen emissions and improving air quality in the Tampa Bay Area.\nThe Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) finalized in 2011 by the EPA requires states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that contribute to fine particle pollution and ground-level ozone in downwind states. This rule replaced EPA’s 2005 Clean Air Interstate Rule. Local power plant upgrades, including replacing coal-burning plants with natural gas facilities and installing nitrogen reduction equipment on smoke stacks, resulted in a 95-ton per year decline in nitrogen emissions between 2002 and 2012.\nTampa Electric Company (TECO) replaced its coal-fired Gannon plant at Port Sutton in 2003 with the H.L. Culbreath Bayside Power Station, a 1,800 megawatt natural gas plant. According to TECO, the switch from coal to natural gas reduced nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 99 percent and particulate matter emissions by 93 percent from 1998 levels. TECO also reported that NOx emissions from the 1,700 megawatt, coal-fired Big Bend Power Station in Apollo Beach declined 91 percent from 1998 emission levels by using technology that converts NOx into N\\(_2\\) and water. In 2004, TECO reduced emissions of particulate matter by 87 percent over 1998 levels by optimizing emission control units. In addition, more than $23 million in scrubber upgrades have resulted in a 94 percent reduction of sulfur dioxide levels compared to 1998 levels.\nDuke Energy (formerly Progress Energy) converted its Bartow Power Plant at Weedon Island in 2009 from fuel oil to natural gas, reducing emissions by more than 80 percent, including a 98 percent reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions.\nSince 2001, Florida Power and Light (FPL) has transitioned from burning more oil than any other utility in the nation to having less than 0.1 percent of its electricity generation produced from oil. Locally, FPL added a new natural gas-fueled generator at its Manatee County power plant and converted two existing units to co-fire natural gas and oil.\nBoth TECO and FPL began operating universal solar energy facilities in 2017. FPL’s 74.35-megawatt Manatee Solar Energy Center is among several large-scale facilities completed or planned by the company throughout Florida. The Manatee site houses 338,000 solar panels, enough to cover five football fields.\nTECO launched a 23-megawatt photovoltaic (PV) array with more than 200,000 solar panels near the Big Bend Power Station. The system has the capacity to power more than 3,300 homes.\nDespite its abundant sunshine throughout the year, Florida — the Sunshine State — lags nationally in solar production. In 2016, Florida voters approved a State Constitutional Amendment to provide property tax breaks for people who install solar panels on their homes.\n\n\n\nTECO solar array.\n\n\nAmerica’s fleet of cars and trucks is becoming more energy efficient. New Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were adopted in 2012, but are currently being reevaluated. Progress continues in developing hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered cars. Sales of battery-powered and plug-in hybrid cars in the U.S. increased by 37% in 2016, to 159,139 vehicles. Meanwhile, the Tampa Bay Area Regional Transit Authority (TBARTA) formed in 2007 to address regional transit needs was dissolved in 2023 .\nMany opportunities exist to promote energy conservation that saves consumers money and reduces NOx emissions. Examples include:\n\nThe EPA’s voluntary Energy Star program helps businesses and individuals save money and protect the environment by identifying and promoting energy efficient products, homes and businesses. Since its inception in 1992, the Energy Star program has helped consumers save $362 billion dollars on utility bills and prevent 2.5 billion tons of greenhouse gasses.\nA variety of rebate programs, free energy audits and other incentive programs are sponsored by local utilities such as TECO, FPL and Duke Energy to increase efficiency of appliances, heat pumps, air conditioning ducts and insulation.\nUF/IFAS Extension provides a wealth of general information about energy efficiency and “living green” including specific information about energy-efficient lighting, heating, cooling and landscaping.\n\nDespite significant reductions in nitrogen emissions from power plants and vehicles and improved energy efficiency of buildings and appliances, rapid population growth in the Tampa Bay Area may offset some of these gains. As population size and energy demand grow, continuing reductions in per capita energy use and air pollution will be needed, especially from vehicles, to maintain and improve the region’s water quality and quality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

Continue sediment quality and benthic monitoring in the bay and expand to tidal tributaries and rivers. Incorporate benthic community targets in management plans.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Using the Tampa Bay Benthic Index, eight priority hot spots were identified in Tampa Bay. A Sediment Quality Action Plan was developed for the highest priority site, McKay Bay, and initial assessment has been completed.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMonitoring of benthic, or bottom, habitats has been ongoing since 1993 with more than 1,500 samples analyzed for environmental contamination, including chemical and physical indicators and biological indicators like benthic community composition. The Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) coordinates the Tampa Bay Benthic Monitoring Program with participation from Manatee and Pinellas Counties.\n\n\n\nScientists prepare to sift through a sample of bay sediment to look for benthic invertebrates.\n\n\nOver the last 20 years, the condition of Tampa Bay benthic communities baywide has been “Fair” to “Poor”, with “Good” conditions in Middle and Lower Tampa Bay in most years and lower trending scores in Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay. Based on these long term monitoring data, increased benthic monitoring of major river systems (e.g., Hillsborough, Palm, Alafia and Little Manatee Rivers) and minor tidal tributaries is needed (see Action BH-8), and benthic community indicators and targets should be incorporated into tidal stream habitat management plans (see Actions BH-1 and BH-9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenthic monitoring is important for identifying hot spots of sediment contamination. Using monitoring data, the Tampa Bay Benthic Index (TBBI) provides a tool for assessing the health of benthic habitats. This index assesses the severity of contamination based on lack of diversity or abundance of benthic organisms, low dissolved oxygen or high levels of contaminants of concern (COCs). COCs include toxic chemicals like heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs) and organic pesticides. Because COCs can persist for decades in aquatic sediments and some can bioaccumulate in the food web, these hot spots pose health risks to fish, wildlife and humans.\n\n\nSediment Contaminants of Concern for Priority Areas of Tampa Bay.\nSOURCE: TBEPPesticidesPCBsHPAHsMetalsUpper Hillsborough BayxxxxLower Hillsborough BayxxMcKay BayxxxBoca Ciega BayxxBayboro HarborxxxAdjacent to BayboroxxWestern Old Tampa Bayxxx\n\n\nIn 2007, the Sediment Quality Assessment Group identified eight priority “hot spot” areas in Tampa Bay with low TBBI scores, indicating elevated contamination and reduced benthic diversity.

SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nThrough a cooperative effort of TBEP partners, a Sediment Quality Action Plan (SQAP) was developed in 2011 for the highest-ranking hotspot, McKay Bay, where 46% of benthic sediments are contaminated by PAHs, PCBs and metals in concentrations high enough to threaten the organisms living in the bay. Despite its urban location and impacted sediments, McKay Bay provides important wildlife habitat with its diversity of mudflats, mangroves, saltmarshes and oyster bars. The McKay Bay SQAP recommends initial steps to 1) identify and control external sources of COCs from upland sites with known soil or groundwater contamination and from stormwater runoff, and 2) assess ecological and human health risks from contaminated sediments.\n\n\n\nEcosystem impacts from contaminated sediments can manifest across the food web from planktonic organisms and benthic infauna to fish and birds who feed on them. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nFollow-up studies in 2014, funded by the Tampa Bay Environmental Restoration Fund, showed McKay Bay sediments are toxic to some animals. In tests of a variety of fish and shellfish, PAHs found in clam tissues exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection Agency thresholds for ecological effects in some areas; and two PAHs found in test animal tissue exceeded EPA screening levels for human health of subsistence fishers at all McKay Bay sites. These results highlight the need for continuing risk assessments and tracking of updated standards. The last baywide risk assessment for COCs was published in 1995.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

Support and monitor advancements in analytical techniques to directly detect, identify and track waterborne microbial pathogens. Support adoption of best available detection, identification and source tracking methodologies. Increase public education and awareness about waterborne fecal pathogens, beach advisories and best practices to reduce public exposure.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Action revised from Action PH-2 Continue source and risk assessments of human and ecosystem health indicators suitable for subtropical marine beaches and waters.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTampa Bay Area beaches and recreational waters are nationally recognized for their outstanding natural beauty. They provide recreational opportunities to residents and visitors alike, and support Tampa Bay’s diverse economy, especially its recreation and tourism industries. Maintaining suitable water quality at beaches and other recreational waters is foundational to protecting Tampa Bay’s environment and economy.\n\n\n\nThe Healthy Beaches Program regularly monitors public beaches around the bay for bacterial contamination.\n\n\nWaterborne microbial pathogens (pathogenic microbes) occur naturally in the bay, but many locations experience fecal contamination periodically from various sources including sewer overflows, domestic livestock, pets and humans (see Actions PH-4, PH-5, WW-2, WW-3 and WW-5). Early detection of pathogenic microbes is critical to public health and to public confidence in monitoring and risk assessments of health threats.\nBacteria, viruses and protozoa can cause a variety of human illnesses ranging in severity from rashes, ear, nose and throat infections and diarrhea to antibiotic-resistant infections, cholera and typhoid fever. Some naturally occurring bacteria (e.g. Vibrio vulnificus) may also pose human health concerns for those who consume raw seafood or have suppressed immune systems. Increasing water temperatures due to climate change may enhance susceptibility to these bacterial infections and facilitate the introduction of potential new pathogens from tropical environments.\n\n\n\nThe harmful bacteria Vibrio vulnificus is transmitted by eating raw or undercooked shellfish or swimming in saltwater with an open wound. Photo from the Centers for Disease Control. SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control\n\n\nFecal coliform bacteria, especially Escherichia coli (E. coli) are widely used as indicators for waterborne pathogens. Coliform bacteria occur naturally in animal feces, and when detected in high concentrations may indicate the presence of co-occurring harmful pathogens. However, because they are present in the feces of a wide variety of animals, they do not pinpoint human sources of contamination. Moreover, Florida’s subtropical climate allows fecal coliforms to grow and multiply naturally in the environment. These shortcomings can reduce the consistent predictive value of the presence of coliform bacteria as an indicator of more harmful pathogens and their threats to human health.\nA study of alternative, more accurate indicators of pathogens sponsored by the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) and Pinellas County identified enterococci bacteria (Enteroccocus species) as the best fecal indicator bacteria for subtropical marine waters (Rose et al. 2001), because 1) they have a greater correlation with water-related gastrointestinal illness in both marine and freshwater than other fecal indicator bacteria, and 2) they can survive longer in saltwater. However, because enterococci bacteria are shed in feces of all warm-blooded animals, they cannot be used to pinpoint human contamination sources. The study ultimately recommended the use of enterococci, along with fecal coliform bacteria, while proposing source tracking of fecal coliform to fingerprint the types of bacteria originating from human sources.\n\nRose, J. B., J. H. Paul, M. R. McLaughlin, V. J. Harwood, S.Farrah, M.Tamplin, and G.Lukasik. 2001. “Healthy Beaches Tampa Bay: Microbiological Monitoring of Water Quality Conditions and Public Health Impacts.” 03-01. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/12cfmGcr1u_W7j5nf12D9O6X0H4fVUtgC/view?usp=drivesdk.\nCurrently, both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) use E. coli as an indicator of bacterial contamination in freshwater systems, and enterococci for marine waters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause of the importance of water quality to local economies many counties and municipalities assumed responsibility for performing their own beach water testing when the state reduced funding for monitoring.\n\n\nArea county health departments collect water samples weekly at area beaches and analyze them for enterococci and fecal coliform bacteria. City and county water quality departments assist in collecting these samples. Area health departments issue advisories or warnings when conditions warrant, although a consistent link between exposure to indicator organisms and public health risk remains elusive.\n\n\n\nBeaches monitored for water quality in the Tampa Bay Area. SOURCE: FDOH Florida Healthy Beaches Program\n\n\nAlthough great gains in protecting public health have been made using fecal indicator bacteria, viral pathogens may actually cause a significant portion of waterborne illness. Because viruses and bacteria respond differently to water treatment processes and environmental degradation, traditional fecal indicator bacteria may not be good indicators for their presence. Research into bacteriophages, or viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria, hold promise for developing better indicators of viral pathogens. EPA suggested that coliphages (viruses that infect and replicate within E. coli) may be better indicators of viruses in fecal contamination and may yield more accurate methodologies for evaluating water quality and protecting public health (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2015).\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2015. “Review of Coliphages as Possible Indicators of Fecal Contamination for Ambient Water Quality.” EPA-820-R-15-098.

Locally, the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) is funding a microbial source tracking study of fecal contamination in the Bullfrog Creek/Sweetwater Creek watersheds. Results will help pinpoint specific sources and inform reduction or prevention strategies.\nNew methodologies can now detect and identify the genetic material from multiple pathogens in water samples (Li et al. 2015). This direct, multi-target approach has the added benefit of eliminating false negatives (i.e., concluding waters are safe, when they may not be) from measuring the wrong indicator or pathogen.\n\nLi, X., V.

    "text": "Reduce pollution from recreational boaters\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to promote marina, boatyard and boater education and best practices. Increase availability of sewage pumpout stations and mobile pumpout vessels. Encourage creation of appropriately sited mooring fields near sewage pumpout facilities or services. Encourage enforcement of rules prohibiting sewage discharges, especially for liveaboards and unmaintained vessels outside of marinas or mooring fields. Survey and identify problem areas for unregulated liveaboards. Support state and local programs to remove derelict vessels.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nMoved from Action WQ-2 and revised to focus on waste management issues associated with recreational boats.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nPollution resulting from improper boating practices includes sewage discharges, release of toxic chemicals, oil and fuel spills, stormwater runoff from marinas and boatyards, abandoned and derelict vessels, marine debris and discarded monofilament line or other fishing gear. This action focuses on the need for additional sewage pumpout services for marinas, identification and management of liveaboards, removal of derelict vessels and continued education about clean boating practices for boaters, marinas and mooring fields. Other boating impacts (such as handling of waste and monofilament line, and safe operation in manatee and seagrass areas) are addressed elsewhere in the CCMP (see Actions PE-1, PA-1, BH-3 and FW-1).\n\n\n\nRemoval of derelict vessels is often a lengthy and costly process for state and local agencies.\n\n\nMore than 150,000 boats are registered in Hillsborough, Manatee, Pasco and Pinellas Counties, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The number of registered vessels in the Tampa Bay area grew by fifteen percent between 2016 and 2022 with Manatee County registrations increasing by forty-three percent. Pinellas County ranked second and Hillsborough County fifth in number of registered boats statewide in 2022. The vast majority of these boats are 16 to 26 feet long. The popularity of recreational boating highlights the need for baywide adoption of responsible boating practices to protect water quality, human health and aquatic habitats.\n\n\nFlorida Boat Registrations by County for 2016 and 2022.

These voluntary recognition and designation programs provide no-cost assistance to marinas and boatyards in implementing Best Management Practices to protect sensitive habitats, manage waste and stormwater, prevent spills and prepare for emergencies. There are 45 designated Clean Marinas or Clean Boatyards in the Tampa Bay region.\nDischarging raw sewage into waterways threatens environmental and human health. The Clean Vessel Act of 1992 prohibits discharge of sewage into Florida’s inland and offshore waters extending nine miles out into the Gulf of Mexico. Boaters must legally store sewage generated onboard using an approved treatment device or holding tank and use an authorized waste dump receptacle, pumpout facility or pumpout vessel to permanently dispose of waste when in port.\nPermits for new marinas and mooring fields, or renovations to existing ones, do not automatically require pumpout facilities or pumpout vessels. They are typically required, however, if the proposed marina or mooring field includes slips for liveaboards, or there are water quality issues in the area. Clean Marinas are encouraged, but not required, to provide pumpout facilities. As of summer 2017, pumpout facilities are available at 55 marinas in the four coastal counties of Tampa Bay, and 26 of these are Clean Marinas.\nThe Clean Vessel Act established a grant program administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which provides funding for purchase, installation, maintenance, repair and operation of boater pumpout and dump stations. The City of Clearwater purchased a pumpout vessel with Clean Vessel Act funding and provides mobile pumpout services one day a week. Facilities receiving funding from the Act must make pumpout services available to the public for free, or for a nominal charge. As of December 2015, the Act has prevented more than 20 million gallons of sewage from contaminating Florida waterways.\n\n\n\nMarinas with pumpout facilities in theTampa Bay Region. Designated Clean Marinas are encouraged but not required to provide pumpout stations. SOURCE: FDEP\n\n\nIncreasing access to authorized waste disposal receptacles and pumpout facilities and improving boater understanding about the legal, environmental and human health consequences of illegal sewage discharges are important strategies to reduce sewage pollution from recreational boaters.\nSpecial attention is required to identify and address illegal sewage discharges from liveaboards and unmaintained vessels outside of regulated marinas and mooring fields. A unified, shared spatial database of liveaboards or unmaintained boats across the Tampa Bay Area is needed to better understand the distribution and abundance of these vessels in the area and to prioritize management actions (e.g., enforcement, relocation to marinas, creation of regulated mooring fields or additional pump out vessels to service these locations) at local trouble spots. Enforcement action is hampered by difficulties in catching violators in the act. Trouble spots may include areas around Hurricane Hole, Terra Ceia, Williams Park Boat Ramp, Clearwater Memorial Causeway and Davis Island Boat Ramp. Increasing the availability or capacity of appropriately sited mooring fields may reduce illegal sewage discharges by aggregating boats in managed areas with adjacent or mobile pumpout services.\nAbandoned and derelict vessels can cause environmental damage by physically impacting sensitive marine and coastal habitats (see Action BH-4) or by discharging sewage, oil, toxic chemicals and marine debris.\n\n\n\nA baywide inventory of liveaboards is needed to assist in identifying “hotspots” for sewage discharge. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nVessels can be classified by law enforcement as “derelict” if they are “left, stored, or abandoned in a wrecked, junked, or substantially dismantled condition upon any public waters of this state, at any port in this state without the consent of the agency having jurisdiction thereof, or docked or grounded at or beached upon the property of another without the consent of the owner of the property.” Severe storms, such as hurricanes, are often a catalyst for the creation of additional derelict vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFlorida law defines a vessel at risk of becoming derelict as:\n\nOne that is taking on or has taken on water without an effective means to get the water out;\nOne with spaces that are designed to be enclosed but are incapable of being sealed off or remain open to the elements for extended periods of time;\nOne that has broken loose or is in danger of breaking loose from its anchor;\nOne that is left or stored aground unattended in such a condition to prevent the vessel from getting underway, or;\nOne that is listing due to water intrusion, or is sunk or partially sunk.\n\n\n\nIt is unlawful in Florida to store, leave or abandon any derelict vessel in state waters. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) or any law enforcement agency can relocate or remove any derelict vessel in the state and the vessel owner is liable for all costs. However, the time between initial identification of a derelict vessel and its eventual removal can be a long and drawn-out process, and removal is costly. In 2021, the Legislature passed a new law that empowers law enforcement to take action on at-risk vessels. For 2022, the Florida Legislature allocated $8.3 million for derelict vessel removal statewide. Hillsborough County owns its own salvage equipment for derelict vessel removal. Pinellas pays a per-foot removal fee to a contracted marine salvage company, with costs covered by the county’s share of boat registration fees.\nThe FWC’s At-Risk Vessel Program allows law enforcement agents to identify vessels at risk of becoming derelict, before they become a problem. Law enforcement officers can tag these vessels and issue violation notices to owners who refuse to improve a vessel’s seaworthiness and secure mooring or storage. At-risk vessels are tracked in a statewide database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

Promote development and delivery of tools and incentives to expand low impact/green infrastructure implementation, including: professional training; compatibility reviews of local government development codes and comprehensive plans; and demonstration sites. Encourage Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) partners to submit local projects that implement innovative building or site design techniques to the Action Plan Database of the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium. Encourage adoption and implementation of regional policies facilitating low impact/green infrastructure development.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nRevised from previous SW-10 Design and Implement a Low Impact Development Strategy.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nHistorically, stormwater management in Florida focused on rapidly removing rainwater from the built environment to avoid flooding. High volumes of polluted runoff were routed to the nearest receiving water body through extensive networks of gutters, ditches, canals and pipes. This management approach often resulted in polluted waterways, impacts to fish, wildlife and habitats and loss of economic and recreational opportunities that depend on healthy waters.\n\n\n\nThe Straz Center for the Performing Arts was the first building in Tampa with a green roof. It is located on the second level of Ferguson Hall. SOURCE: Straz Center\n\n\nFlorida Law requires that all new and redevelopment projects manage the first inch of rainfall onsite rather than discharging to storm drains. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) have determined that Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) applicants for new construction discharges in the Tampa Bay watershed must meet more stringent standards by demonstrating net improvement (i.e., no degradation) to waterways, because Tampa Bay is not meeting all water quality standards in all areas of the bay.\nCommunities across Florida are now replacing outdated stormwater management systems with more innovative ones that can simultaneously reduce flooding while protecting the natural environment. These practices may also advance beneficial uses of reclaimed water (see Action WW-1) and comprehensive management of water resources within the watershed.\nGreen Infrastructure practices (also known as Low Impact Development or Low Impact Design) reduce and treat stormwater at its source, minimizing the volume of water and pollution discharged from the built environment. At the city or county scale, Green Infrastructure is a patchwork of natural areas that provides habitat, flood protection, cleaner air and cleaner water. At the neighborhood or site scale, green stormwater management systems mimic nature by soaking up and storing water, thereby reducing flow of pollutants to water bodies.\n\nEXAMPLES OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNIQUES:\n\nPervious surfaces for parking areas, walkways, and drives can reduce runoff from small rain events, allowing gradual infiltration into underlying soils. Pervious surfaces include pavers, bricks, gravel, shell and porous concretes.\nRetention areas like rain gardens, vegetated swales and recessed tree islands are small depressions designed to capture runoff and allow it to evaporate or percolate into the ground. Associated vegetation can take up water and nutrients.\nVegetative buffers and littoral zones around shorelines, ponds and waterways can filter pollutants and litter from runoff before it enters a waterbody. Specifically, biological communities (including bacteria) provide valuable nutrient removal services. Harvestable floating vegetated islands can increase the effective area over which plants can remove nutrient pollution from conventional detention ponds (see Action BH-6).\nRainwater harvesting systems, such as rain barrels and cisterns, can capture rainfall and store it for later use.\nCanopy trees and green roofs can intercept rainfall before it hits the ground. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study found that for every 10 percent increase in tree cover (up to 60%), water treatment costs decreased by approximately 20 percent (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2007).\n\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2007. “Reducing Stormwater Costs Through Low Impact Development (LID) Strategies and Practices.” EPA 841-F-07-006.

An analysis of 17 case studies across the United States reported a 15 to 80 percent cost savings over conventional stormwater methods, with only a few exceptions.1 Many benefits were not monetized in this review, including improvements to water quality, human and environmental health, recreational opportunities, aesthetic value, property value, natural habitat and quality of life. Consideration of these broader watershed-scale benefits is important to evaluating the overall cost-benefits of Green Infrastructure applied on a parcel or local scale and is an important area for more research.\nA variety of barriers exist to implementing Green Infrastructure, including lack of awareness of techniques; lack of accurate information about costs and benefits; limited opportunities for technical training and practice; homeowner association rules and deed restrictions; and outdated language in development codes and comprehensive plans that impede innovative practices. For example, a 2014 review of Hillsborough County construction and development codes identified a variety of provisions that discouraged, limited or otherwise prevented the use of low-impact development techniques (Tetratech 2014).\n\nTetratech. 2014. “Summary of Green Infrastructure Inconsistencies and Barriers in Codes and Guidance with Action Items for Hillsborough County.” 08-14.

K. Ruppert, and M. J. Kipp. 2008. “Protecting Florida’s Water Quality: Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Implementation of Low Impact Development (LID) Practices.” Gainesville, Florida: University of Florida Water Institute.\nA survey of Florida developers, professionals and government officials identified potential strategies for overcoming some of these barriers (Clark et al. 2008), including:\n\nEducation, outreach and marketing to the building community and public;\nLand development code and comprehensive plan language amendments;\nIncentives for advanced stormwater treatment, such as integrating stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) with open space and landscape code requirements;\nResearch and demonstration projects;\nProfessional training for both public and private sector representatives responsible for design and review of stormwater systems.\n\nThe stormwater regulatory environment in Florida is slowly evolving to encourage and facilitate adoption of Green Infrastructure principles and techniques.\nFDEP drafted a new Statewide Stormwater Treatment Rule in 2010, which was never adopted. The effort was renewed with a new series of rule-making workshops in 2022 and 2023. If adopted, it would be the first update since the original 1982 rule. The draft rule proposes to increase the level of nutrient removal required from stormwater treatment systems serving new development, such that post-development nutrient loads do not exceed loads from comparable natural, undeveloped areas. The draft rule aims to create a unified statewide standard supporting the underlying objectives of low-impact development.\nThe Florida Legislature adopted a statewide ERP Rule (Chapter 62-330, F.A.C.) in 2013. A new two-volume Applicant’s Manual accompanies the Rule. Applicant’s Handbook Volume I is applicable statewide and provides general background and summaries of relevant statutes, rules, types of permits, system operation and maintenance and other general topics. Applicant’s Handbook Volume II contains Water Management District-specific design and performance criteria for stormwater quantity, quality, flood control and other special basin-specific criteria. The new ERP Rule and accompanying Applicant’s Manuals require that new stormwater management systems that discharge directly or indirectly into impaired waters must provide net improvement for the pollutants that contribute to the water body’s impairment. To do this, a higher level of treatment is necessary to assure that the permit creates a net environmental benefit. However, in many cases, redevelopment is often exempt from the stricter stormwater treatment standards, for all or part of the redeveloped property.\n\n\n\nVegetative shorelines help filter and treat runoff entering stormwater ponds.\n\n\nAdopted in 2017 and revised in 2021, Pinellas County’s new stormwater manual is designed to be used in conjunction with the Pinellas County Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Code. Recognizing that Pinellas County is almost entirely built-out, the manual and revised development codes incorporate a variety of Green Infrastructure techniques especially appropriate to redevelopment, adaptive reuse and retrofits. Hillsborough County adopted a stormwater manual in 2021. The TBEP, in partnership with the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, is planning a two-phase project in 2024 to develop a multi-jurisdictional stormwater master plan in the Old Tampa Bay watershed and implement high priority stormwater retrofits to reduce nonpoint source nutrient loads in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Implement the nutrient management strategy for Tampa Bay\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to implement the nutrient management strategy for Tampa Bay to maintain water quality necessary to support seagrass at or above target levels. Document trends in water quality and track nutrient reduction and prevention actions within the watershed. Develop and implement nutrient criteria recommendations and management strategies for the bay’s tidal streams.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) continues to maintain the Nitrogen Reduction Action Plan Database and prepare Reasonable Assurance documentation for water quality requirements. TBEP further supported: 1) establishment of estimates for atmospheric deposition to Tampa Bay watershed sub basins and waters, 2) establishment of estimates of nitrogen loading from residential fertilizer and irrigation and corresponding nutrient load reductions associated with fertilizer restrictions and 3) development of numeric nutrient criteria recommendations for Tampa Bay.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nControlling nitrogen input into the bay as a means to regain vital seagrass beds has been one of TBEP’s most prominent initiatives. Seagrasses were selected as a metric by which efforts to improve the bay are measured because of their overall importance as a bay habitat and nursery, and because they are an important barometer of water quality.\n\n\n\nBecause seagrass requires clear water to flourish, it is a valuable indicator of water quality in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: Jimmy White\n\n\nIn 1995, TBEP adopted a goal of restoring seagrass to 1950 levels after decades of decline (Robison et al. 2020). Reaching this goal required collaboration from local governments, industries, and citizens to reduce nutrients throughout the watershed. The nationally recognized Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium (TBNMC) — an alliance of more than 45 local governments, regulatory agencies and key industries bordering the bay — played a leading role in reducing nitrogen loadings in the bay. TBNMC members developed voluntary water quality and nutrient loading targets to support TBEP’s seagrass recovery goals.\n\nRobison, D., T. Ries, J. Saarinen, D. Tomasko, and and C. Sciarrino. 2020. “Tampa Bay Estuary Program: 2020 Habitat Master Plan Update.” 07-20. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hp0l_qtbxp1JxKJoGatdyuANSzQrpL0I/view?usp=drivesdk.\nBetween 1992 and 2021, this partnership implemented 496 nitrogen load reduction projects through a combined $836 million investment that precluded 950.3 tons/year of nitrogen (TN) from entering Tampa Bay. Baywide nutrient loads declined and water clarity improved to the equivalent of the 1950s period and seagrass coverage reached a peak of 41,655 acres in 2016, surpassing the revised restoration goal of 40,000 acres. By 2022, the bay had only 30,137 acres of seagrasses, a significant decrease of 11,518 acres even though water quality standards were met in all bay segments except Old Tampa Bay. TBEP and partners will reassess the assimilative capacity for nitrogen, beginning with the Old Tampa Bay segment, continue to investigate major drivers causing this loss (see WQ-3), and continue to make significant investments towards implementing projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaywide seagrass coverage versus management goal of 40,000 acres.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved a regulatory Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Tampa Bay; in 2007, EPA required all permitted nutrient sources within the Tampa Bay watershed to adhere to annual numeric loading limits, or allocations, for their nitrogen discharge to Tampa Bay. The TBNMC proactively developed voluntary nitrogen loading limits for themselves and submitted those limits as recommended allocations to EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), rather than relying on the regulatory agencies to develop the limits for them. Both EPA and FDEP encouraged and participated in this effort, which was led by TBEP.\n\n\n\nSources of nitrogen loading to Tampa Bay, 1970s versus current\n\n\nAs outlined in the 2009 and 2012 Tampa Bay Reasonable Assurance documents, TBNMC members developed fair and equitable allocations for all 189 permitted sources within the watershed that total the federally-recognized TMDL for Tampa Bay. Consequently, both FDEP and EPA accepted the recommended allocations as meeting water quality requirements for Tampa Bay. In 2011, the TBNMC further developed recommended numeric nutrient criteria consistent with the bay’s nutrient loading targets, which were subsequently adopted by the State in 2012.\n\n\n\nScreenshot for TBEP Action Plan Database for tracking nitrogen management projects by Nitrogen Management Consortium Partners.\n\n\nThe Tampa Bay nutrient management strategy has become a national and international model for successful watershed management collaborations. TBNMC success has utilized a multifaceted approach to reduce nutrient impacts to the bay, including stormwater treatment (see Action SW-10), wastewater reuse and aquifer recharge (see Action WW-1), septic conversions and reduction in sewer overflows (see Actions WW-2, WW-3 and WW-5), reduction in fertilizer use (see Action SW-8), process improvements for industrial manufacturing and power plants (see Action AD-1), habitat rehabilitation and restoration (see Action BH-1) and homeowner education (see Action SW-1).\nExamples (with corresponding reduction in Total Nitrogen, TN, where available) include:\n\nStormwater treatment projects such as the City of Clearwater’s Cliff Stephens Park Stormwater Retrofit Project (5.8 tons/yr TN reduction)\nAtmospheric deposition reduction projects such as Tampa Electric Company’s repowering of Gannon Power Plant Bayside (1.9 tons/yr TN reduction)\nIndustrial manufacturing process upgrades such as those at CF Industries (now Mosaic) Bartow Phosphate Complex (18 tons/yr TN reduction)\nAgricultural water and fertilizer reductions such as citrus and row crop conversion to micro-irrigation in Hillsborough County (2 tons/yr TN reduction)\nWastewater discharge to reuse such as Hillsborough County’s South County Reuse System (17.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nRegional restoration and stormwater treatment creation such as Southwest Florida Water Management District’s Cockroach Bay Restoration Project (0.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nOverlay districts requiring additional stormwater treatment such as Manatee County’s Development and Agricultural Overlay District in the Lake Manatee watershed (9.6 tons/yr TN reduction)\nResidential fertilizer ordinances restricting the use of nitrogen fertilizer during the rainy season adopted by Pinellas County, Manatee County, and cities of St. Petersburg, Clearwater and Tampa (an estimated 6% reduction in TN stormwater runoff)\nStream and creek rehabilitation such as Pinellas County’s Allen’s Creek Rehabilitation Project (0.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nLake sediment rehabilitation such as the City of St. Petersburg’s Lake Maggiore Dredging Project (1.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nPoint discharge to deep well injection such as Tropicana’s Deep Well Injection Project (11 tons/yr TN reduction)\nEducation campaigns addressing homeowner actions to reduce stormwater runoff such as UF/IFAS Extension’s Florida Friendly Landscaping™ and TBEP’s Be Floridian campaign.\n\n\n\n\nWater quality sampling sites in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: EPCHC\n\n\nPeriodic assessments of the bay’s condition using nutrient-related metrics are now required by FDEP for TBEP partners and the TBNMC. These reporting requirements include annual water quality reports and 5-year Reasonable Assurance (RA) demonstrations that assure that the Tampa Bay Nutrient Management Strategy continues to meet state and federal water quality requirements. Reporting elements in the RA document include 5-year nitrogen loadings from all sources, compliance assessments with approved allocations, water quality trends in each bay segment, and identification of current and future actions to reduce nutrient loadings to Tampa Bay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Water Quality Report Card summarizes the thousands of water quality records from EPCHC to simply convey the status of each bay segment relative to management targets and regulatory thresholds\n\n\n\n\nWater quality and seagrass conditions in Old Tampa Bay fell below goals during the 2017-2021 RA period. Since hydrologically normalized TN loads are being met, but chl-a exceedances and seagrass losses are still occurring, the TBNMC will reassess the assimilative capacity of Old Tampa Bay. Furthermore, TBEP and Consortium partners continue to implement habitat restoration, stormwater infrastructure, and point source improvement projects focused in Old Tampa Bay and throughout the Tampa Bay watershed that cumulatively contribute to the bay’s overall ecological improvement. The next Tampa Bay RA report, which covers the 2022-2026 period, is due to FDEP by December 2027. Additional planned and budgeted projects are expected to reduce TN loading by 70.5 tons per year.\nEfforts to implement a similar nutrient management strategy in Tampa Bay tidal streams are underway (see Action BH-9). Ongoing research includes development of environmental indicators and thresholds of tidal stream health and nursery function to protect wetland systems against nutrient impairment and a management framework for their restoration (Wessel et al. 2021). This framework establishes proactive metrics that can be utilized by partners to implement watershed restoration actions that can reduce nutrient inputs to tidal streams. An open science tidal tributaries dashboard shows a screening-level evaluation of water quality for 225 creeks. Research explores the relationship between nutrient dynamics and tidal stream condition, advancing regional knowledge of these important low-salinity habitats, as well as informing and prioritizing management actions that may be needed to protect or enhance the ecology of these systems.\n\nWessel, M.

    "text": "Expand the beneficial use of reclaimed water\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nEncourage and expand beneficial water reuse to reduce nutrient loadings from wastewater discharges and enhance ecosystem benefits. Track the regional strategy and practices for Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) and direct recharge projects to strengthen understanding of their cumulative effect on ground and surface water quantity and quality. Strengthen understanding of the contribution of nutrients and other constituents from beneficial uses of reclaimed water to Tampa Bay.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Nitrogen load estimates to Tampa Bay from all sources, including reclaimed water, were developed in 1994 and updated in 2001 and 2005. The Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium developed a Nutrient Management Strategy, with regular updates and assessments in 2007, 2009 and 2012 on the nitrogen loading reductions from reclaimed water projects. Estimates of nitrogen loading from irrigation were developed in 2008, leading to recommendations for reduced fertilizer application with reclaimed water irrigation incorporated into the Model Fertilizer Ordinance developed by TBEP. The potential presence, fate and transport of emerging contaminants of concern and microplastics in reclaimed water, wastewater, and other sanitary sewer systems warrants further investigation (see Action COC-4).\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nUse of reclaimed water in the Tampa Bay watershed continues to grow rapidly, with dozens of new projects expected to be online by 2022, reducing the region’s dependence on groundwater while preventing nutrient-rich wastewater effluent from discharging into the bay. New technologies for treating and disposing of wastewater and stormwater are being tested and implemented, continuing to advance the Tampa Bay Area’s national reputation for innovation.\n\n\n\nPasco County plans to use reclaimed water to recharge wetlands, such as these at Crews Lake Wilderness Park. SOURCE: Pasco County\n\n\nReclaimed water can provide a valuable source of freshwater to the bay area — for example, to enhance wetlands, prevent saltwater intrusion into coastal areas or to augment low-salinity habitats identified as important for juvenile fisheries. For that reason, TBEP has encouraged water managers and local governments to retain reclaimed water within the bay watershed.\nTBEP plays an important role in tracking nutrient load reduction from all projects, including reclaimed water initiatives, via the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium’s Action Plan Database. Between 2017-2021, new load reduction projects reduced total nitrogen load by 420.9 tons/yr; about &lt;1% from reuse/reclaimed water projects. The next calculation of nitrogen load reduction throughout the watershed will encompass 2022-2026. Additional planned and budgeted projects are expected to reduce TN loading by 70.5 tons/yr, with 10.5% from reuse and reclaimed projects.\nIn 2015, 38% of the flow from 49 permitted wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the four-county Tampa Bay region was beneficially reused. Still, in 2015 more than 173 mgd of treated wastewater were released. In 2020, there were 22 reclaimed water projects under development across the 4-county area, including transmission pipelines, pump stations, storage tanks and ponds, aquifer recharge, storage and recovery systems and feasibility studies. These projects could supply an additional 49 mgd of reclaimed water to the region. In its 2020 Regional Water Supply Plan, the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) projected that by 2040 almost 75% of wastewater could be utilized across Pinellas, Pasco, Hillsborough and Manatee Counties.\n\n\nRegional reclaimed water reuse in 2015 and projected reuse by 2040\n(SOURCE: SWFWMD)CountyActual 2015Projected 2040WWTP FlowReuse% ReuseWWTP FlowReuse% ReusePasco29.817.960%40.130.175%Pinellas109.144.841%113.284.975%Hillsborough109.526.624%141.8106.375%Manatee29.915.953%38.328.775%Total278.3105.238%333.325075%\n\n\nAquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) systems have enormous potential for diverting highly treated wastewater flows from disposal into the bay and balancing wet and dry season supply-and-demand inefficiencies. Reclaimed ASR systems inject treated wastewater deep into various underground aquifers, where it is stored in porous rock. From there, it can be pumped back to the surface and distributed for residential, commercial and industrial use. Exploratory wells are drilled to ensure the reclaimed water can be safely stored in the local geologic formations; additional wells drilled around the reclaimed water injection well are monitored for any possible groundwater contamination.\n\n\n\nAquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) injects treated wastewater into an isolated aquifer during the rainy season and pumps it out for reuse during dry season. SOURCE: WaterInnEU Marketplace\n\n\nThere are several reclaimed water ASR facilities in the Tampa Bay Area, with two more under development by the cities of Oldsmar and Palmetto. Some recharge wells, when drilled near the coast with the right geologic conditions, can slow and potentially stop saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. For example, the South Hillsborough Aquifer Recharge Project (SHARP) is a pilot project designed to inject 2 mgd of highly treated reclaimed water into several wells in the Apollo Beach area to create a barrier to saltwater intrusion.\nWith additional treatment, reclaimed water can be injected directly to recharge the aquifer. The Clearwater Replenishment Project will use state-of-the-art treatment technology to purify 2.4 mgd of wastewater to exceed drinking water standards, then inject it into a brackish water zone below the fresh water zone of the Upper Florida Aquifer.\nThe City of Tampa, which produces approximately 58 mgd of Advanced Wastewater Treated (AWT) effluent on an average annual basis, has considered several strategies to store and recover reclaimed water in the Floridan aquifer for subsequent delivery to the Hillsborough River system.\nAnother method for “recycling” wastewater is by indirect aquifer recharge. Treated wastewater is released above ground to spray fields or to treatment and infiltration basins, typically man-made ponds or wetlands, where it can percolate back into groundwater. Pasco County relies primarily on spray-fields and rapid infiltration basins (RIBs); the county is conducting ongoing feasibility studies and planning for an innovative wetland recharge area in central Pasco County. In this public-private partnership among SWFWMD, Pasco County and land owners, wastewater effluent will be biologically treated and infiltrated through a series of constructed wetlands to reduce nutrient concentrations from 9 to 1 mg/L total nitrogen.\nThe City of Tampa conducted a feasibility study incorporating the use of RIBs and ASR wells for delivering AWT wastewater from the City of Tampa’s Howard F. Curren wastewater treatment plant to wetland areas along the Tampa Bypass Canal. From there, the water would seep into the ground and eventually into the Tampa Bypass Canal, potentially increasing water available for pumping into the Hillsborough River Reservoir.\n\n\n\nMore than 200 golf courses in West Central Florida are irrigated with reclaimed water. SOURCE: Manatee County\n\n\nAnother potential use of reclaimed water is piping it from densely populated coastal areas to inland areas for reuse and/or recharge. For example, in 2016 the City of Bradenton completed a project to transfer 100% (5.57 mgd) of its reclaimed water to Lakewood Ranch for landscape irrigation — reducing direct surface water discharge in Manatee County by 90%. Similarly, there are opportunities to interconnect coastal WWTP utilities with spray fields and RIBs in eastern Pasco and Hillsborough Counties.\nThe City of St. Petersburg is designing an innovative wastewater reuse project at its Southwest Wastewater Reclamation Facility. The facility is being restructured to consolidate and treat biosolids, creating an alternative to traditional disposal and land application of this wastewater treatment byproduct. Biosolids will be transformed into higher fertilizer-grade biosolids suitable for sale in gardening centers. Bio-gas from the treatment process will be captured, cleansed and compressed for use on-site and as vehicle fuel.\n\n\n\nSt. Petersburg’s Southwest WWTP is producing fertilizer from bio-solids and fuel from bio-gas generated by the treatment process.\n\n\nMost reclaimed water construction projects include educational components that promote the value and benefits of efficient and effective water management. SWFWMD and local government utilities provide outreach to homeowners, school facility managers, government buildings, parks and open spaces, hospitals and golf courses on the proper application and maintenance of reclaimed water systems for landscaped areas. SWFWMD has a well-developed web page on water reclamation and reuse information, including GIS and other data, as well as educational publications. The Pinellas County South Cross Bayou Water Reclamation Facility and the St. Petersburg facilities offer tours and educational programming.\nThe Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ Program, delivered by UF/IFAS County Extension offices throughout the region, emphasizes water conservation and efficient use of alternative water sources for watering. Additional education is needed to inform residents, golf course and property managers that fertilizer application can be reduced or eliminated where reclaimed water is used for irrigation. This message was a key theme of TBEP’s Be Floridian fertilizer education campaign. Pinellas County currently provides an online map of reclaimed water service areas, with corresponding fertilizer recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Require standardized monitoring and reporting of wastewater discharges\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nRequire standardized monitoring and reporting of wastewater discharges to improve the accuracy and timeliness of pollutant loading estimates. Provide access to an up-to-date, publicly accessible database of industrial and domestic wastewater discharges. Develop and maintain an ongoing Tampa Bay-specific summary of information for loadings of core pollutants reported to the monitoring database.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Action revised to incorporate new information on improvements to reporting of wastewater discharges.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nImproved water quality has produced a resurgence of healthy seagrass meadows and associated fish and invertebrate communities in Tampa Bay. Protecting these gains requires diligent monitoring of pollutant inputs (loading) to the bay. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) regularly estimates loadings of core pollutants, including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS) and more recently, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).\n\n\n\nThe South Cross Bayou Water Reclamation Facility is Pinellas County’s largest wastewater treatment plant. SOURCE: Pinellas County\n\n\nPollutant loadings are estimated from a variety of sources, including atmospheric deposition, domestic and industrial point sources, groundwater, springs and nonpoint sources. Accuracy and timeliness of pollutant loading calculations is critical to development of loading estimates used by the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium (NMC) to prepare Tampa Bay Reasonable Assurance (RA) documents. These data also are needed for Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs) and other documents necessary to meet regulatory requirements and for tracking the long-term recovery of the bay (see Action WQ-1).\nAlthough improvements to domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have significantly reduced their water quality impact, they remain a small, but significant source of pollutant loading. In 2015, approximately 122 million gallons of treated wastewater were discharged into Tampa Bay per day. From 2011-2020, industrial and domestic wastewater discharges contributed an average of 5% and 12% of total nitrogen loading to Tampa Bay, respectively.\nAbout a quarter of WWTPs in Florida are authorized to discharge treated wastewater (effluent) directly to surface waters under National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. The remaining plants are authorized to discharge effluent to groundwater through land-application, beneficial use of reclaimed water or deep well injection (see Action WW-1). The Legislature passed a law in 2021 requiring domestic wastewater utilities that dispose of effluent, reclaimed water, or reuse water by surface water discharge to submit a plan for eliminating non-beneficial surface water discharge by January 1, 2032.\nWastewater treatment plants self-monitor and report their own discharges to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) through monthly or quarterly Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), as required by their permits. All permitted facilities are required to monitor and report on the chemical composition of effluent discharges, but the specific parameters they monitor can vary from facility to facility, based on permit requirements. This is particularly problematic for estimating loadings from industrial WWTPs — their permits often require them to only report a subset of nutrient forms (e.g., ionized ammonia, orthophosphate), and often in a way (e.g., without concomitant flow data) that makes it difficult for resource managers to calculate accurate and timely loading estimates for core pollutants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEzDMR\n\n\n\nThe Electronic Discharge Monitoring System (EzDMR) is an electronic reporting tool that saves time and reduces the potential for errors from manual entry of data. It provides instant access to a facility’s current reporting requirements, as well as the status and history of a facility’s reports.]\n\n\nTBEP’s primary interest is consistent reporting of TN to accurately calculate loading estimates for the Reasonable Assurance process. Consistent reporting of TP, TSS and BOD as appropriate would also be helpful.\nAnother challenge to calculating accurate and timely pollutant loading estimates for WWTPs was that facilities traditionally could submit DMRs in hand-written or paper format. This required FDEP to enter data into databases by hand, which took time and could lead to data entry errors and significant lags in reporting data.\nEPA recently promulgated E-reporting rule 80 FR 64063, which requires NPDES permitted facilities to electronically report and share data. This improvement will enhance transparency by providing a timelier, complete, more accurate and nationally consistent set of data in a more accessible form. As of December 2016, FDEP requires all NPDES wastewater and stormwater facilities to submit DMRs through their web-based Electronic Discharge Monitoring Report System (EzDMR). Compliance data from DMRs is accessible to the public through FDEP’s OCULUS website. Locally, the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County also maintains records of DMRs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",
