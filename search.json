    "text": "Increase on-water enforcement of environmental regulations\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nImprove enforcement of environmental regulations protecting fish and wildlife by supporting marine law enforcement efforts via sustainable funding, education of personnel, adoption of new technologies and boater and angler education.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. This action has been expanded to incorporate enforcement of manatee protection zones. Action also expanded to increase compliance with environmental laws through targeted education using new technologies, improve reporting and response times and revive a regional effort to support increased funding for on-water enforcement. Boater and angler education to reduce the need for enforcement is an important element of this Action.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAdequate enforcement of local, state and federal laws protecting fish and wildlife remains a challenge in the Tampa Bay Area. The need to balance human uses with ecosystem needs will increase as the bay draws more boaters, anglers and other recreational enthusiasts.\n\n\n\nOfficer on the water. SOURCE: Tim Donovan\n\n\nThe number of registered pleasure and commercial boats in the three counties bordering the bay increased 13.3%, from 109,063 to 123,545, between 2016 and 2022. At the same time, however, local governments reduced or eliminated their marine patrol units when tax revenues sagged during the economic downturn of 2008–2011. The main on-water enforcement agency, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s (FWC) Division of Law Enforcement, has been stretched thin in recent years. FWC assumed additional duties related to Homeland Security, especially escorts of large commercial ships transiting the bay.\nFWC’s merger of fresh and saltwater law enforcement agencies has expanded the pool of officers trained to enforce both salt and freshwater regulations, with added flexibility to shift officers to “hot spots” or priority problems, such as illegal gill-netting. Additionally, all law enforcement rangers with Florida’s state parks were reassigned to FWC in 2011.\n\n\n2016 versus 2022 Florida Boat Registrations for Tampa Bay Counties\nSOURCE: Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles20162022% IncreaseHillsborough40,78242,3303.8Manatee18,52726,46442.8Pinellas49,75454,75110.0Totals109,063123,54513.3\n\n\nDespite these changes, fewer than 40 FWC officers (including lieutenants and captains who spend limited time in the field) are available to provide continuous on-water coverage in Tampa Bay. That equates to one officer for every 2,636 boats. There are frequent staffing shortfalls as officers typically only remain with FWC for about five years before taking more lucrative positions with federal or local law enforcement agencies. Citizens who report potential violations are often frustrated when officers are unable to respond in a timely fashion, or at all.\nThe small FWC staff is charged with ever-increasing responsibilities both on and off the water, from enforcing safe boating laws and the bay’s extensive manatee protection zones, to ensuring that sport and commercial fishermen comply with gear and harvest restrictions, to responding to nuisance alligator complaints, enforcing hunting regulations, and even conducting state-required inspections of homemade vessels.\nProspects for a substantial boost in FWC personnel appear dim, and requests to increase the percentage of revenues from the Saltwater Fishing License allocated to marine law enforcement have not been successful. One bright spot may be an increase in local city or county marine officers, as tax revenues rebound and communities respond to growing natural resource and boating safety concerns within their own waters.\n\n\n\nAs of 2017, about 40 state marine enforcement officers patrol Tampa Bay, one for every 2,636 boats. SOURCE: FWC\n\n\nThis action encourages utilization of new technologies, such as mobile applications and text messages tagged with GPS locations, to facilitate timely reporting and response to violations. Also recommended is the possible revival of the “Coastwatch” volunteer program that trains citizens who are on the water frequently to identify and report violations directly to local FWC officers. Participants would receive training in key resource protection laws and direct contact numbers for law enforcement officers, bypassing the central dispatch system. This may not result in faster response time to any individual infraction, but would be useful in alerting officers to priority problem areas for targeted enforcement — for example, hot spots of manatee zone violations, illegal netting and boating while intoxicated. The program also would improve communication and collaboration among frequent bay users and law enforcement in general, leading to enhanced enforcement.\nContinued education and awareness of boating safety protocols to reduce impacts on wildlife will reduce some of the need for regulatory remedies. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) is a leader in boater education, partnering with FWC to develop the popular Boating and Angling Guide to Tampa Bay (including an interactive, web-based version) and with Audubon Florida on localized guides to Hillsborough Bay, Boca Ciega Bay and Lower Tampa Bay. TBEP’s Bay Mini Grant program funded Tampba Bay Waterkeeper to develop and launch a Patrol Program in 2023.\nTBEP’s Manatee Awareness Coalition (MAC) helps coordinate boater education efforts among a diverse alliance of boating groups, scientists, bay managers and manatee advocates to increase compliance with the bay’s extensive network of manatee protection zones. Regulated areas include both seasonal and year-round slow speed zones, as well as two no-entry areas adjacent to warm-water outfalls at TECO’s Big Bend Power Plant in Apollo Beach and Duke Energy’s Bartow Power Plant at Weedon Island. The Big Bend plant is among Florida’s most important winter manatee refuges; the Bartow plant is a valuable secondary refuge. The MAC worked with FWC and navigation providers Garmin and Navionics to add Tampa Bay manatee zones to navigation software (and related mobile phone applications) used by boaters. The next innovation should be electronic alarms on personal navigation or smartphone devices that alert boaters when they are about to enter a manatee protection zone.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay has an extensive network of seasonal and year-round slow speed zones to protect manatees.\n\n\nUltimately, additional funds for law enforcement are needed to adequately keep pace with increased use (and potential abuse) of the bay and its valuable habitats and inhabitants. Funding for enforcement, as well as marine research and management, could come from reviving the license fee for shoreline anglers. A $9 fee enacted in 2009 was expected to generate $900,000–$1.2 million a year in revenues, but was repealed a year later. The license is now free and voluntary.\nEnforcement funds could also come from requiring that residents and/or non-residents using professional fishing guides purchase an individual fishing license. An estimated 2 million tourists fished in Florida in 2014, far outpacing any other state. Currently, charter captains purchase an annual license that covers all anglers on board their boat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Enhance ecosystem values of tidal tributaries\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nImprove the ecosystem value of tidal tributaries of Tampa Bay. Develop indicators of tidal tributary health and function. Continue monitoring in tidal tributaries. Identify and implement projects to remove artificial barriers in tidal tributaries. Improve public awareness of the value and benefits of healthy tidal tributaries.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Originally added to the CCMP as a 2012 Amendment, this revision incorporates pilot projects to remove or modify structures, and monitor changes in water quality, vegetation and fisheries use. This update also summarizes new research to characterize tidal tributaries to facilitate development of monitoring metrics.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTidal tributaries are an important, diverse and often-neglected ecosystem in the bay watershed. Distinctly different from freshwater systems and the open bay, these variable-salinity streams, creeks and back-water systems serve an important niche in fisheries production, nutrient cycling, wading bird foraging and flood prevention or detention.\n\n\n\nA typical tidal tributary in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nSince 2006, select tidal creeks of the Tampa Bay watershed have been monitored to evaluate tidal patterns, shoreline vegetation, fish populations, sediment quality and nutrient levels (see Action FW-5). Despite water quality often characterized by low dissolved oxygen levels and higher relative nutrient and chlorophyll levels, these systems have been shown to support high densities of juvenile fishes and baitfish species. Research coordinated by the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) found that juvenile snook — a premier sport fish — were up to 36 times more abundant inside the sampled tributaries than outside (Sherwood 2008).\n\nSherwood, E. 2008. “Tampa Bay Tidal Tributary Habitat Initiative: Integrated Summary Document.” 02-08. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ox3GGKs_Ab3VorrHF4EhZQZFd1ETjK7o/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\nJanicki Environmental and Mote Marine Laboratory. 2020. “Southwest Florida Tidal Creeks: Nutrient Management Framework and Indicator Development.” 02-20. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n4okSVtNSswVXv1Lje-qMopNZdvUrQnt/view?usp=drivesdk.\nCurrent efforts include research supported by US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Wetlands Development Grants to develop environmental indicators of tidal tributary health and nursery function (Janicki Environmental and Mote Marine Laboratory 2020). Due to large differences from creek to creek, results suggest there is no single optimum water quality criterion for setting appropriate nutrient targets and thresholds to maintain ecological productivity. Instead, tidal creek health may be more reliably predicted by a nutrient management framework that includes a variety of indicators, especially recruitment and survival of juvenile fishes. Continued and long-term tidal creek biological monitoring is warranted, especially expansion of monitoring efforts to inventory ecological conditions in unsampled creeks (see Action FW-5). A tidal creeks dashboard provides site-specific creek condition indicators to help managers prioritize management actions.\n\n\n\n\n\nTidal Creeks in the Tampa Bay Watershed.\n\n\n\n\nMost of the more than 100 tidal creeks in the bay watershed are less than six miles long and narrow, averaging about 75–150 feet wide. Many have been significantly altered by dredging, road construction, shoreline development and channelization to facilitate flood control. A 2012 inventory commissioned by TBEP identified 344 structures that are potentially blocking or impeding tidal flows and fish movement in bay tributaries (Deitche and Dooris 2012). These barriers include water control structures, weirs, railroad bridges, culverts and road crossings. Fish and wildlife also are impacted by channelizing and ditching natural creeks for mosquito control, flood prevention and general upland development.\n\nDeitche, S., and P. Dooris. 2012. “Tampa Bay Salinity Barrier Inventory & Restoration Feasibility Matrix.” 09-12. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/13YBw59NbRalybAeF2U_bht602CwG489H/view?usp=drivesdk.\nRemoving some of these “salinity barriers” could benefit snook and other fish by promoting more natural fluctuations in water levels that occur with rising and falling tides, instead of the irregular and often large pulses of nutrient-laden waters released from the highly altered systems during heavy rains. Removal or modification of physical barriers also enhances the overall connectivity of the bay’s tidal habitats.\nRestoration efforts are often complicated by such factors as public versus private ownership of the barriers and adjacent land, potential impacts to surrounding property owners, contrasting management objectives (flood control vs. water quality protection) and overall water quality benefits of restoring hydrologic function relative to costs.\n\n\n\nMany of the more than 100 tidal creeks draining to Tampa Bay have been channelized for flood control.\n\n\nPilot projects sponsored jointly by TBEP and the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) in Pinellas County (Channel 5) and Hillsborough County (Channels A and G) have helped to quantify costs, techniques and issues, creating a basic framework by which additional projects can be evaluated and incorporated into future restoration plans. A restoration of Roosevelt Canal flowing into Old Tampa Bay is underway in 2023. Projects like these and related public outreach and education are prioritized for Bipartisan Infrastructure Law funding.\nModifying a weir and restoring a shoreline near the mouth of Channel 5, a highly channelized tributary just east of the St. Petersburg-Clearwater Airport, should attract small baitfish, crabs and other marine creatures that serve as food for larger fish like snook as well as wading birds. Channel 5 connects to what was originally a natural tidal creek (Badwater Creek) that was ditched in the 1950s to drain the surrounding wetlands for development and agricultural uses. When complete, this project will create more than 76 acres of low-salinity habitat.\nAdditionally, two water control structures on Channels A and G in the Rocky Creek and Brushy Creek watersheds in upper Tampa Bay are being kept open indefinitely to monitor water quality and fisheries changes resulting from unrestricted tidal flow. Channels A and G were originally constructed to prevent flooding of nearby lands, and the two structures were installed in the 1970s to prevent salt water from moving upstream and penetrating to the groundwater system through breaches created by construction of the channels.\nAs part of the pilot study, manatee exclusion barriers on both structures also were removed so that all fish and wildlife, including manatees, could travel upstream. Vegetation above and below the structures is being monitored to determine if saltwater wetland plants like marsh grass and mangroves will expand over time. Other techniques currently being used to restore tidal flows to support fish and wildlife include blocking mosquito control ditches and blasting or excavating mounds created by ditching in mangrove forests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome 159 of the 344 structural barriers identified on tidal creeks in the bay watershed are in Old Tampa Bay, contributing to persistent water quality problems there.\n\n\nPublic workshops held in conjunction with both of these pilot projects highlight the importance of communicating project goals to nearby residents, and promoting public understanding of tidal creeks as vital nurseries for popular recreational fish, foraging grounds for wading birds, natural stormwater treatment areas and resilient habitats that can adapt to rising seas.\n\n\n\nSampling of tidal creeks throughout the watershed is enhancing knowledge of their value to fisheries. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nTogether, these research, monitoring and restoration efforts represent a comprehensive approach to improved overall management and protection of tidal tributaries throughout the bay watershed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Encourage habitat enhancement along altered waterfront properties\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nExpand use of living shorelines instead of traditional seawalls along waterfront properties. Support demonstration projects; explore regulatory rule revisions to support living shorelines; assess the use of living shorelines to mitigate climate change; and support education of waterfront homeowners about the benefits of living shorelines.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Revised to broaden focus on softening shorelines of privately and publicly owned waterfront properties to address coastal erosion, as a preferred alternative to coastal armoring. Action also recognizes potential for living shorelines to bolster coastal resiliency to sea level rise.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nExtensive industrial, commercial and residential development has dramatically reshaped the bay’s natural shorelines, especially in urban areas. TBEP’s first assessment of habitat losses, conducted in the early 1990s, estimated that more than half of the natural shoreline of Boca Ciega bay was altered by widespread dredging of hardened, finger-fill residential canals.\n\n\n\nNatural recruitment of mangroves at a seawall enhancement project at Water Works Park in Tampa. SOURCE: Victoria Parsons\n\n\nAlthough new “canal communities” are prohibited, the original developments remain, and vertical seawalls, revetments, riprap and bulkheads still dominate new waterfront development. Property owners in Florida are allowed to replace most existing seawalls without a permit. A 2015 report from Restore America’s Estuaries, offers mounting evidence that hardened, artificial shorelines increase erosion, harm water quality and magnify storm damage and flooding (Restore America’s Estuaries 2015). The report also notes that seawalls and other hardened shores provide poor habitat for fish and wildlife.\n\nRestore America’s Estuaries. 2015. “Living Shorelines: From Barriers to Opportunities.” Arlington, Virginia: Restore America’s Estuaries. https://estuaries.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/RAE_LS_Barriers_report_final.pdf.\nIn contrast, living shorelines embrace “softer,” more natural materials that buffer wave action, absorb storm impacts, filter pollutants and provide food and shelter for fish, shellfish and wading birds. Even “living seawalls” (habitat installed in front of existing seawalls) are preferable, as these are superior to a vertical wall structure alone.\nLiving shorelines also help to reduce impacts associated with climate change and sea level rise by buffering the effects of increased storm and floods. They protect dunes, mangrove forests and other coastal habitats that shield manmade infrastructure and support wildlife. Case studies illustrating how coastal communities throughout the Gulf of Mexico are incorporating living shorelines into habitat restoration and protection projects to improve long-term resiliency to sea level rise are presented in the Gulf Coast Community Handbook prepared by TBEP.\n\n\n\nA continuum of shoreline types from green softer techniques to gray harder techniques. SOURCE: NOAA Office of Habitat Conservation\n\n\nAccurately defining a living shoreline is critical to widespread use and acceptance by permitting agencies and the public. NOAA describes living shorelines as “a broad term that encompasses a range of shoreline stabilization techniques along estuarine coasts, bays, sheltered coastlines and tributaries. A living shoreline has a footprint that is made up mostly of native material. It incorporates vegetation or other living, natural “soft” elements alone or in combination with some type of harder shoreline structure (e.g., oyster reefs or rock sills) for added stability. Living shorelines maintain continuity of the natural land-water interface and reduce erosion while providing habitat value and enhancing coastal resilience.”\nExamples in Tampa Bay include the Ulele Spring restoration in downtown Tampa (rock revetment and native plants); the MacDill Air Force Base Living Shoreline project (oyster reefs and salt marsh grass); and the oyster reef/breakwater along the Alafia Bank Bird Sanctuary. Examples of “living seawalls” include oyster domes along downtown St. Petersburg and Tampa waterfronts.\nThe 2015 Restore America’s Estuaries report identifies three major barriers to widespread use of living shorelines:\n\nReliance among regulators on familiar, traditional shoreline stabilization techniques, and lack of information about both the shortcomings of those methods and the benefits of living shorelines.\nLack of a wide-angle view of shoreline management, leading to site-specific permit reviews of individual applications that overlook the cumulative effects of hardening shores and the potential values of living shorelines to mitigate habitat loss, flooding and sea level rise.\nLack of a coordinated constituency to advocate for living shorelines.\n\n\n\n\nShoreline stabilization at MacDill Air Force Base. Bags of oysters were installed to reduce erosion and provide habitat. SOURCE: MacDill AFB\n\n\nBarriers are both institutional and educational. Creation of a living shoreline requires a permit; replacement of existing seawalls usually does not. In 2017, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers authorized a new nationwide general permit for living shorelines, making the permitting process easier. However, few waterfront property owners know about eco-friendly alternatives to hard structures. The complex permitting process, length of time it takes to obtain a permit, and the need for a qualified contractor to design and install living shorelines effectively serve as a disincentive to their acceptance and use. In locations where living shorelines alone may not be appropriate, NOAA encourages placing habitat in front of existing seawalls, a so-called living seawall. Sarasota Bay Estuary Program’s Living on the Water’s Edge brochure is an example of practical information about this topic for citizens. With support from TBERF, a Living Shoreline Suitability Model and accompanying story map were developed by FWC in 2019.\nThe Vertical Oyster Garden project, a partnership with Sarasota Bay Estuary Program, Manatee County and TBEP, encourages dock owners to help restore oysters by adopting strings of recycled oyster shells collected from local restaurants and hanging them off their dock. When suspended in brackish water, they provide an ideal habitat for young larval oysters to settle and grow.\nHardened structures are often necessary to protect property in areas of high wave energy and will remain a visible feature along bay and river shorelines. This action seeks to expand use of living shorelines in areas of moderate to low wave energy. The Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) incorporates definitions and opportunities for living shorelines (Robison et al. 2020).\n\nRobison, D., T. Ries, J. Saarinen, D. Tomasko, and and C.

    "text": "Reduce propeller scarring of seagrass and pursue seagrass transplanting opportunities\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nEnhance seagrass recovery by reducing propeller scarring of seagrass; evaluate effectiveness of seagrass planting techniques; pursue seagrass restoration opportunities at appropriate sites and continue boater education.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Action updated to reflect adoption of extensive manatee protection zones that also protect seagrasses. Action also updates propeller scarring and seagrass transplanting research. Strategy revised to focus scope of seagrass transplanting program, and to evaluate effectiveness of manatee zones in reducing propeller scarring. Targeted boater education is an important element of this Action.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSeagrasses create important habitat and forage for many important bay species (see Action BH-1). Seagrass meadows are relatively fragile and can easily be damaged by human activity, such as careless boat operation that leaves propeller scars resembling plowed furrows.\n\n\n\nA diver measures the width of a prop scar in a seagrass bed. SOURCE: Florida Department of Environmental Protection\n\n\nSubstantial progress has been made in implementing actions which may reduce seagrass scarring. An extensive network of year-round and seasonal slow speed zones established primarily for manatee protection also serves to safeguard seagrasses in shallow nearshore waters — although adequate enforcement of these zones remains a challenge (see Actions FW-1 and FW-6). Slow speed zones generally encompass waters 6 feet deep or less, mirroring the average depth range of seagrass beds in the bay.\nNo-motor or “poll and troll” zones at Weedon Island and sections of Fort De Soto Park also help protect manatees and seagrasses by restricting use of internal combustion engines in shallow waters. No-entry security zones around MacDill Air Force Base and Port Manatee provide de facto seagrass protection.\nSeagrass scarring is a persistent problem. New boaters or boaters new to Tampa Bay may find themselves suddenly grounded in the bay’s shallows and resort to “propeller dredging” through grass beds to reach deeper water. Boater education about safe navigation in shallow waters is an important solution to reduce seagrass scarring. TBEP initiated a project in 2021 to map hot spots and conduct targeted education through the Be Seagrass Safe campaign. In addition, TBEP has allocated funding to develop digital technologies (including electronic chart displays, smartphones and other emerging platforms) that provide real-time information to boaters and alert them when they are entering slow-speed or no-motor zones.\n\n\n\nPropeller scars in seagrasses in Lower Tampa Bay near Fort De Soto Park. SOURCE: Tampa Bay Watch\n\n\nA statewide survey of seagrass scars conducted in 1995 found that 65% of seagrasses within Hillsborough County, 45% of seagrasses within Manatee County and 42% of seagrasses within Pinellas County were lightly to severely scarred (Sargent et al. 1996). The 1995 survey preceded adoption of the slow-speed manatee protection and no-motor zones now in place. Slow speed and no-motor zone regulations have not been evaluated in more than 15 years to determine if, and to what extent, they have reduced scarring or promoted healing of scars. A recent analysis of the 2020 SWFWMD seagrass coverage maps found heavy scarring (&gt;20%) in the areas near Terra Ceia (Manatee County) and Fort De Soto (Pinellas County), and moderate scarring (5-20%) in areas near Cockroach Bay (Hillsborough County) (Tuckett et al. 2022).\n\nSargent, F.

St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SK-rkH1QmYytUgU7atIexYjgzKQtjEc7/view?usp=drive_link.\nInitial studies indicated that scarred beds may take 3.6 to 6.4 years to return to normal density, if no additional damage occurs during that period. However, more recent research conducted by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) and the University of South Florida in the Cockroach Bay Aquatic Preserve showed that prop scars can heal rapidly. The EPCHC study, which utilized side-scan sonar, found that shoal grass (Halodule wrightii) recolonized scarred areas within 6 months. Recovery also was observed in turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) beds. Pinellas County officials also reported success with using “sediment tubes” to facilitate regrowth of shoal grass in prop scars, as part of mitigation for the Belleair Beach Causeway Bridge.\nMore research is needed to determine whether these results can be reliably replicated in other scarred areas with different sediment types and currents, and for slower-growing manatee grass (Thalassia or Syringoidum filiforme). Although the impacts of seagrass scars on fish and shellfish have not been well studied, research conducted in 2002 in Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor showed no significant declines in species abundance in beds with up to 50% scarring (Bell et al. 2002).\n\nBell, S. S., M. O. Hall, S. Soffian, and K. Madley. 2002. “Assessing the Impact of Boat Propeller Scars on Fish and Shrimp Utilizing Seagrass Beds.” Ecological Applications 12 (1): 206–17. https://doi.org/10.1890/1051-0761(2002)012[0206:ATIOBP]2.0.CO;2.\n\n\n\nVolunteers assist in a seagrass planting project. SOURCE: Tampa Bay Watch.\n\n\nAlthough limited seagrass transplanting has been implemented in several areas around Tampa Bay, evaluation of successful techniques and monitoring of seagrass transplantation success is needed. Only about 100 acres of the 20,000-acre increase in bay seagrasses since 1990 has resulted from transplanting efforts — water quality improvements account for the vast majority of gains. Restoring seagrasses naturally through nutrient management should continue to be the primary focus of restoration efforts.\nHowever, transplanting may be a locally important tool for “jump-starting” restoration where seagrass recovery is lagging, sudden losses occur (e.g., due to a spill or extreme weather event) or as mitigation for unavoidable impacts. Several methods of transplanting seagrasses have been employed in Tampa Bay. Early efforts utilizing small units of seagrass had poor survival rates, as the newly planted grasses were easily washed away by tides and currents. More recent projects have had success transplanting larger clumps or “sods” of seagrass that include the native soil and intact root systems. These units — measuring about 8 inches by 8 inches — are often able to withstand more turbulent water conditions until the grass is fully established.\nA multi-year project conducted by Tampa Bay Watch and the City of Tampa at MacDill Air Force Base transplanted manatee grass from a natural “donor site” to a nearby location using the sod technique. After two years, seagrass coverage in the transplant area increased 28-fold. Nearly a decade after the first transplantation effort at this location, seagrass cover has continued to expand. An additional quarter-acre of manatee grass was transplanted in six plots in 2012 by EPCHC and Tampa Bay Watch; by late 2015, a 75% increase was observed. It is difficult to determine whether this recovery, and similar restoration or mitigation efforts, is the result of natural recruitment or transplanting activities. Beginning in 2024, TBEP will partner with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) to monitor transplanted seagrass “sods” near Wolf Branch Creek in Middle Tampa Bay, where manatee grazing may be affecting seagrass coverage.\n\n\n\nSeagrass for transplanting projects is typically harvested from healthy “donor beds.” SOURCE: Tampa Bay Watch\n\n\nSeagrass survival is influenced by multiple factors, including water clarity, sediment type, rainfall, epiphyte coverage and wave energy. Location and depth at which plantings occur may be more important than the technique used. Just like land-based plants require specific optimum environmental conditions to flourish, transplanted seagrass, regardless of technique, will not survive if the location and environment are not appropriate.\nMitigation for construction-related impacts typically requires permittees to track and report survival to the permitting agencies for a limited period only. Long-term monitoring (greater than 3 years) of restoration and mitigation projects is needed to determine the most cost-effective and successful methods and to identify appropriate planting strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Implement the Tampa Bay Habitat Master Plan\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nImplement the Tampa Bay Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) to restore and protect key bay habitats under “Maximize the Potential” management paradigm, taking into account anticipated population growth, changing land use patterns, and impacts of climate change and sea level rise. Support research and monitoring necessary to meet data and information gaps for priority habitats targets. Continue to encourage restoration and protection of priority habitats, through acquisition and restoration programs.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Strategy revised to incorporate research, monitoring and recommendations from the Tampa Bay Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update), the Tampa Bay Tidal Tributaries Habitat Initiative, the Critical Coastal Habitat Assessment Program, and Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment. Action BH-10 is merged with this Action BH-1.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe Tampa Bay Estuary Program and its partners have made significant progress in restoring and protecting key coastal habitats in Tampa Bay. This work is guided by the Tampa Bay Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update), and tracked in the Habitat Restoration and Protection Database.\n\n\n\nHabitat restoration at the Cockroach Bay Aquatic Preserve in south Hillsborough features extensive tidal wetlands valuable as fish nurseries. Photo by Donna Bollenbach.\n\n\nThe first Tampa Bay Habitat Master Plan, completed in 1996, set targets for restoration and protection of mangrove forests, salt marsh, low-salinity habitat in tidal tributaries, isolated small wetlands important as forage areas for estuarine-nesting birds and salt barrens, and introduced the management paradigm of “Restoring the Balance” (Lewis III and Robison 1995). This paradigm recommended the restoration of priority coastal habitats to similar proportions as they occurred historically (circa 1950), to provide a full mosaic of habitats necessary to support fish and wildlife throughout their life cycles. It recognized that some habitats have been lost in greater proportions than others and prioritized their protection and restoration. The 1996 Habitat Master Plan was updated in 2010 (Robison 2010).\n\nLewis III, R. R., and D. Robison. 1995. “Setting Priorities for Tampa Bay Habitat Protection and Restoration: Restoring the Balance.” 09-95. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P5QdzginXe7y94TmvuEhoN8yPt2Yi9sz/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\nRobison, D. 2010. “Tampa Bay Estuary Program Habitat Master Plan Update.” 06-09. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/13iVkFKFG_EMNGwRWdgPPZfCL5JlatNcr/view?usp=drivesdk.\nThe Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) incorporates all of the components recommended in Activity BH-1.1, including a Practical Guide for Habitat Restoration and a reassessment of the “Restoring the Balance” management paradigm (Robison et al. 2020). The 2020 plan establishes 2030 protection and restoration targets and longer-term 2050 goals for Tampa Bay critical coastal habitats. The target setting approach used in this update, termed the “Maximizing the Potential” (MTP) approach, is both retrospective and prospective. It is informed by past changes, as determined through a three-decade habitat change analysis, and over forty years of habitat restoration experience in the region. It is also primarily focused on what is possible today and the projected needs for the future, rather than replicating past ecological conditions. The new paradigm accounts for future stressors – especially sea level rise, climate change, and watershed development – in the target setting process. Furthermore, numeric targets are “place-based,” meaning that they are based on actual “opportunity areas” that can be mapped in the watershed.\n\n\n\nRestoration of wetland habitats has contributed to the dramatic recovery of roseate spoonbill populations in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nPriority natural habitats in Tampa Bay include:\n\nSeagrass meadows\nEmergent tidal wetlands (Mangrove forests, Salt marshes, Salt barrens)\nTidal flats\nOyster reef/bars\nHard bottom\nTidal tributaries, creeks and rivers\nNative uplands\nFreshwater wetlands\n\nThe Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) Program of the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) is a lead architect of habitat restoration in Tampa Bay. Since 1989, SWIM has implemented 96 coastal restoration projects with cooperators, restoring 4,617 acres (7.2 square miles) of coastal habitats. This work has created substantial oligohaline and salt barren habitats, priorities identified in the Habitat Master Plan. An Updated SWIM Plan for Tampa Bay was adopted in 2023 (Garcia, Anastasiou, and Robison 2023).\n\nGarcia, L., C. Anastasiou, and D. Robison. 2023. “Tampa Bay Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) Plan Update.” Brooksville, Florida: Southwest Florida Water Management District. https://www.swfwmd.state.fl.us/sites/default/files/medias/documents/tampa_bay_swim_plan_finalforgb_10242023_0.pdf.\nResearch is underway to better understand tidal creeks and the historic and current areal extents of tidal flats, oyster reefs and hard bottom habitats. New monitoring and mapping approaches and techniques to capture large- and small-scale changes in coastal marshes and mangrove forests are being developed to better understand and potentially mitigate for climate change. Results from these ongoing projects will help managers set restoration and protection targets for tidal flats, oyster reef, hard bottom habitats and tidal tributaries, and better evaluate and track progress toward achieving targets for mangroves and coastal marshes.\nHabitat data assessment needs are identified in the Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update), and programs are recommended to address specific data gaps for: 1) hard bottom; 2) oyster bars; 3) tidal tributaries; 4) coastal uplands; and 5) reclaimed mined lands. Improvements to ongoing monitoring of the status and trends of subtidal, intertidal and supratidal habitats are also recommended.\nStandardized nomenclature to describe critical coastal habitats was developed for the Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) grouping habitats into subtidal (seagrasses, tidal flats, oyster bars, hard bottom, and artificial reefs), intertidal (mangrove forests, salt marshes, salt barrens, tidal tributaries, and living shorelines), and supratidal (coastal uplands, non-forested freshwater uplands, forested freshwater uplands, and native uplands). TBEP has set 2030 restoration and protection targets and longer-term 2050 goals for these Tampa Bay critical coastal habitats.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay critical habitat restoration and protection targets and goals adopted in the Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update). SOURCE: Habitat Master Plan, Table ES-4.\n\n\n\nSubtidal Habitats\nSeagrasses are keystone species in Tampa Bay. Their lush meadows provide food, create habitat, stabilize bay bottom, filter nutrient pollution and reduce wave action and coastal erosion. They may also play an important role in creating micro-refugia from ocean acidification (see Action CC-2). Seagrasses require sufficient water clarity to receive sunlight. In Tampa Bay, water clarity is mostly affected by the density of suspended microscopic algae, which in turn is directly related to the availability of the most limiting nutrient — nitrogen. Between the 1950s and early 1980s, Tampa Bay lost nearly 20,000 acres of seagrass, mainly due to nutrient pollution and dredging.\nIn 1995, Tampa Bay Estuary Program set a baywide restoration target of 38,000 acres for seagrasses and implemented a strategy to improve water quality by reducing nitrogen inputs into the bay (see Action WQ-1). Between 1992 and 2021, this partnership implemented 496 nitrogen load reduction projects through a combined $836 million investment that precluded 950.3 tons/year of nitrogen (TN) from entering Tampa Bay. Baywide nutrient loads declined and water clarity improved to the equivalent of the 1950s period and seagrass coverage reached a peak of 41,655 acres in 2016. The Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) set a target and goal of 40,000 acres.\nBy 2022, the bay had only 30,137acres of seagrasses, a significant decrease of 11,518 acres even though water quality standards were met in all bay segments except Old Tampa Bay. TBEP and partners continue to investigate major drivers causing this loss and make significant investments towards implementing projects (see Action WQ-3). Seagrass communities remain vulnerable to environmental variability and human impacts. Continued biennial mapping of bay-wide seagrass coverage is necessary to identify and protect sensitive and impacted areas (see Action BH-8). Several studies have been conducted to support development of a Tampa Bay Seagrass Restoration and Protection Master Plan (developed as an element of the Habitat Master Plan), including a detailed analysis of historic seagrass change, species composition and condition throughout the bay, refined estimates of light requirements, estimates of wave energy and development of an initial bio-optical model. In addition, the relationship between longshore sand bars and seagrass has been studied and seagrass management areas have been established.\n\n\n\nSalterns, or high marshes, are among the restored habitats at Robinson Preserve in Manatee County. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nTidal flats are non-vegetated intertidal bay habitats composed of sand and organic sediments. They are found primarily along low-energy shorelines and sheltered backwaters. Tidal flats host dense assemblages of benthic invertebrates, which are an important food source for shorebirds and wading birds. SWFWMD has classified tidal flats as part of their biannual seagrass mapping work; however, this effort did not consistently distinguish tidal flats from other non-vegetated estuarine shorelines. In 2015, SWFWMD employed new standards for photo-interpreting and characterizing tidal flats. This improved approach is expected to yield more accurate estimates of the distribution and areal extent of tidal flats. The 2030 target is 16,220 acres.\nHard bottom habitats support a diverse assemblage of invertebrates and fish. Oyster reefs provide food and habitat, reduce erosion, stabilize shorelines and improve water quality. Together, these habitats are relatively rare and sparsely distributed in the bay. No comprehensive map of hard bottom habitats in Tampa Bay exists. In 2015, SWFWMD employed new, more accurate standards for interpreting hard bottom and oyster reefs from aerial photography, as well as new survey techniques including sidescan sonar and underwater video. Expansion of hard bottom and oyster reef mapping bay-wide is needed. The 2030 protection and restoration targets for hard bottom and oyster reef habitats are 423 acres and 221 acres, respectively (see Action BH-4).\n\n\nIntertidal Habitats\nEmergent tidal wetlands (mangrove forests, salt marshes, salt barrens) occur primarily along the intertidal perimeter of the bay and its tidal tributaries, and include mangrove forests, salt marshes and salt barrens. They provide food and habitat for hundreds of species of bay fish and wildlife, stabilize shoreline sediments and reduce erosion, and filter pollutants from runoff. Dominant threats to emergent tidal wetlands are dredge and fill activities, sea level rise and modifications to bay hydrology. The 2023 Economic Valuation of Tampa Bay estimates the flood protection value of saltwater wetlands of Tampa Bay at $924.4 million in avoided damage to real property over 30 years (Todd, Walsh, and Neville 2023).\n\nTodd, A., H. Walsh, and J. Neville. 2023. “2023 Economic Valuation of Tampa Bay.” 09-23.

SOURCE: Donna Bollenbach\n\n\nFrom 1950-1990, almost 21 percent (4,984 acres) of emergent tidal wetlands were lost in Tampa Bay, with salt marshes and salt barrens showing the most disproportionate losses. Between 1990-2020, the areal extent of emergent tidal wetlands increased by about 12% (2,177 acres), with mangroves showing the greatest increase (1,963 acres, 15%), followed by salt barrens (107 acres, 23%) and salt marshes (107 acres, 2%). More than 1,000 acres and 1,000 linear feet of coastal habitat have been restored through the Tampa Bay Environmental Restoration Fund (TBERF). Over time, the relative proportion of mangroves in the bay has increased, while the proportions of salt marsh and salt barren have decreased. Rising sea level is expected to continue to drive these coastal habitat shifts with acreages of mangrove forests increasing at the expense of salt marshes and salt barrens (see Action CC-1) (Sherwood and Greening 2014).\n\nSherwood, E., and H. Greening. 2014. “Potential Impacts and Management Implications of Climate Change on Tampa Bay Estuary Critical Coastal Habitats.” Environmental Management 53 (3): 401–15. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00267-013-0179-5.\nTBEP and its partners set 2030 restoration and protection targets for all three emergent tidal wetland habitats in the Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update), including 15,300 acres of mangrove forests, 546 acres of salt barrens, and 4,807 acres of salt marshes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcres of emergent tidal wetlands: ca1950 and current. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\n\n\nTidally influenced tributaries and streams support fisheries production, nutrient cycling, wading bird foraging and flood prevention (see Action BH-9). The Tampa Bay watershed hosts about 1,400 linear miles of tributaries, creeks and rivers; however, the extent of tidal reach in these water bodies is not comprehensively documented. Baseline research is needed to quantify the total linear miles of tidal tributaries and how they will change with sea level rise, water and land use changes. The 2030 restoration and protection target for tidal tributaries is 4 miles.\nThe Tampa Bay Tidal Tributaries Habitat Initiative was launched in 2010 to study the health and function of tidal tributaries. Highly variable environmental conditions among tributaries make setting a single optimum water quality criterion difficult. Instead, habitat status may be better characterized by the status of fish populations, or some other biological indicator (see Action BH-9). A 2012 study funded by TBEP identified hundreds of structures in tidal tributaries that potentially block or impede tidal flows and fish movement. Additional work to develop biological criteria, monitor fish and wildlife, and prioritize tributaries for restoration was completed in 2019 (Wessel et al. 2021).\n\nWessel, M. R., J. R. Leverone, M. W. Beck, E. T. Sherwood, J. Hecker, S. West, and A. Janicki. 2021. “Developing a Water Quality Assessment Framework for Southwest Florida Tidal Creeks.” Estuaries & Coasts 45: 17–37. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12237-021-00974-7.\n\n\nSupratidal Habitats\nForested wetlands, such as cypress and maple swamps, and non-forested “grassy” wetlands dominated by rushes and low-profile plants provide significant ecosystem services. Healthy wetlands “fix” or capture carbon dioxide and mitigate the effects of climate change. Freshwater wetlands also filter pollutants including nitrogen, reduce flooding and erosion and recharge groundwater.\n\n\n\nNon-forested wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed are dominated by grasses, sedges and other non-woody plant species. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nFreshwater wetlands support more than 80 species of terrestrial and aquatic fish and wildlife. Small, isolated wetlands are especially important for amphibian populations — and are often most at risk for degradation, since wetlands smaller than a half-acre are currently not protected by regulations. Waterbirds and wading birds are particularly dependent on freshwater wetlands. Resident wading birds such as heron, ibis, egrets and endangered wood storks depend on the bay’s freshwater marshes year-round; they also host significant wintertime bird populations.\n\n\n\nSmall, isolated “frog ponds” are important feeding areas for white ibis.\n\n\nOver the past century, urban development and agricultural production have negatively impacted freshwater wetlands in the Tampa Bay watershed. From 1950–2007, the Tampa Bay area suffered a net loss of more than one-third of its freshwater wetlands, amounting to more than 100,000 acres. Non-forested wetlands were disproportionately lost. While direct impacts from development account for the majority of these losses, indirect impacts such as groundwater and surface water withdrawals for urban and agricultural use have also degraded wetlands.\nThe Habitat Master Plan 2020 Update (Robison et al. 2020) supersedes the 2014 Freshwater Wetland Habitat Master Plan (Ries and Scheda 2014), so former Action BH-10 is now merged with this Action BH-1. The Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) specifies restoration and protection targets for forested and non-forested freshwater wetlands, as follows:\n\nRobison, D., T. Ries, J. Saarinen, D. Tomasko, and and C. Sciarrino. 2020. “Tampa Bay Estuary Program: 2020 Habitat Master Plan Update.” 07-20. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hp0l_qtbxp1JxKJoGatdyuANSzQrpL0I/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\nRies, T., and S. Scheda. 2014. “Master Plan for the Protection and Restoration of Freshwater Wetlands in the Tampa Bay Watershed, Florida.” 05-14. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NjExx3M63zmypXN9D1Yc7DNkVpS-8FFm/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\nThe baywide restoration and protection target for 2030 is 68,937 acres of non-forested freshwater wetlands and 152,282 acres of forested freshwater wetlands.\nThe baywide restoration and protection goal for 2050 is 71,787 acres of non-forested freshwater wetlands and 152,732 acres of forested freshwater wetlands.\n\nThe Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) determined that these specific targets were achievable and best accomplished through a combination of publicly financed restoration and privately funded compensatory mitigation. Regulatory permitting agencies have committed to using the Habitat Master Plan to identify and require mitigation of historic wetland conditions. To encourage restoration of non-forested wetlands, mitigation required for development can be directed to grassy systems if applicants can demonstrate that they previously existed in that location. This provides both flexibility and cost-savings for regulatory agencies and permittees, while supporting bay-wide restoration goals.\nThere is a need to provide education and guidance to environmental professionals on how to best use the Habitat Master Plan’s recommendations and tools for wetland mitigation. Pinellas County’s Stormwater Manual provides an innovative model for incorporating wetlands into an integrated stormwater management plan.\nSince 1991, SWFWMD’s SWIM Program has routinely incorporated both estuarine and freshwater wetlands into their habitat mosaic designs as components of stormwater treatment — while simultaneously establishing freshwater wetlands, oligohaline habitats, and salinity gradients important for fisheries production. The SWIM Plan Update adopted in 2023 includes freshwater wetland restoration targets.\nA 2017 study of the long-term viability of constructed freshwater wetlands in Hillsborough County highlights the importance of factors such as design, location in the landscape, and on-going maintenance in the long-term structure and function of constructed wetlands (Brown 2017). Understanding and calibrating designs to future conditions under climate change may also promote long-term success of restorations.\n\nBrown, A. 2017. “Freshwater Wetland Creation in a Changing Urban Environment: Designing for Long-Term Viability.” PhD thesis, St. Petersburg, Florida: University of South Florida.\nForested wetlands also warrant preservation, enhancement and restoration. Old-growth cypress swamps in the bay watershed are largely gone, while younger forests are more common. Cypress trees are slow-growing, vulnerable to hydrologic changes, and provide critical habitat for creatures as diverse as the alligator gar, river otter, wood duck, and limpkin.\n\n\n\nVarious ferns are common features of forested freshwater wetlands. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nCoastal Uplands occur just landward of emergent tidal wetlands, and include mesic flatwoods and hydric hammocks. They provide habitat for a variety of bay wildlife and are important buffers between tidal wetlands and urban and agricultural development. More than 100 acres of coastal upland have been restored in Tampa Bay through the TBERF. The 2030 restoration and protection target for coastal uplands is 3,769 acres.\nNative Uplands host a variety of native terrestrial plant communities, including dry prairies, native grasslands, upland coniferous forests (e.g., pine flatwoods), and upland hardwood forests (e.g., oak hammocks). Between 1990 and 2017, 39% of Native Uplands were lost, primarily due to land development. The SWIM Program has promoted the restoration of various native upland communities, restoring almost 2,000 acres of pine flatwoods, hardwood hammocks, mixed pine-hardwood forests and grassed prairies. Improved quantitative assessments are needed to develop restoration and protection targets for coastal uplands. The 2030 restoration and protection target for Native Uplands is 140,600 acres.\n\n\nClimate Change and Sea Level Rise\nTBEP evaluated and published potential impacts and management implications of climate change on critical coastal habitats. Modeled changes to temperatures and sea level showed that mangrove forests will dominate the overall proportions of future coastal habitats, whereas proportions of salt marshes, salt barrens and coastal freshwater wetlands will decline. Increasing the resilience of coastal habitats and providing them with room to migrate upslope are among the recommended strategies for coping with climate change. The SWIM program already is implementing restoration projects designed to boost the resilience of coastal habitats and help accommodate projected sea level rise.\nThe Critical Coastal Habitat Assessment (CCHA) Program was developed by TBEP to track long-term changes that may occur as a result of sea level rise and climate change (Price, Loy, and Robison 2017). The monitoring plan incorporates a hierarchical approach to allow for multiple scales of inference to be made. The CCHA project established nine long-term monitoring transects - from the open water edge through emergent tidal wetlands to coastal uplands - on both natural and developed portions of the Tampa Bay coastline. Assessments occur every 3-5 years, with the third assessment initiated in 2023 (see CC-1).\n\nPrice, R., D. Loy, and D. Robison. 2017. “Phase 1: Critical Coastal Habitat Assessment: Baseline Monitoring Report.” 08-17. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/122AvajD3fxOVORHfO5HQUMdXkLNoQm48/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\n\n\nAs of 2017, the Rock Ponds Ecosystem Restoration conducted by SWFWMD’s Surface Water Improvement and Management Program was the largest coastal restoration project in Tampa Bay. Straddling the border of Hillsborough and Manatee counties, Rock Ponds encompasses 1,043 acres of coastal wetlands and uplands. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\n\n\nLand Acquisition and Protection\nThe first Tampa Bay Habitat Master Plan identified 28 sites for acquisition, protection, management and/or restoration. Of those, 19 were purchased and 10 have undergone restoration activities. Both SWFWMD and Hillsborough County (through the Jan K. Platt Environmental Lands Acquisition and Protection Program) have acquired lands on the master list. The Master Plan (2010 Update) inventoried public and private parcels in the Tampa Bay watershed that should be prioritized for restoration efforts. Public sites included 12 in Pinellas County, 18 in Manatee County and 19 in Hillsborough County.\nThe Habitat Master Plan (2020) carries forward the 2010 recommendation to develop a federal-state-local-private partnership to provide the framework for linking watershed-level planning goals for restoration with federal, state and local wetland compensatory mitigation. It further recommends improving coordination between regulatory and resource management programs in the Tampa Bay watershed through the TBEP Habitat Restoration Consortium.\nCoastal land available for restoration and acquisition is dwindling as development expands. Accordingly, projects further up in the watershed are gaining importance. This shift in focus recognizes that habitats — such as tidal tributaries and freshwater wetlands far removed from the bay proper — are critical to its health and is consistent with the need to move up slope to accommodate rising sea levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Require standardized monitoring and reporting of wastewater discharges\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nRequire standardized monitoring and reporting of wastewater discharges to improve the accuracy and timeliness of pollutant loading estimates. Provide access to an up-to-date, publicly accessible database of industrial and domestic wastewater discharges. Develop and maintain an ongoing Tampa Bay-specific summary of information for loadings of core pollutants reported to the monitoring database.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Action revised to incorporate new information on improvements to reporting of wastewater discharges.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nImproved water quality has produced a resurgence of healthy seagrass meadows and associated fish and invertebrate communities in Tampa Bay. Protecting these gains requires diligent monitoring of pollutant inputs (loading) to the bay. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) regularly estimates loadings of core pollutants, including total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total suspended solids (TSS) and more recently, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD).\n\n\n\nThe South Cross Bayou Water Reclamation Facility is Pinellas County’s largest wastewater treatment plant. SOURCE: Pinellas County\n\n\nPollutant loadings are estimated from a variety of sources, including atmospheric deposition, domestic and industrial point sources, groundwater, springs and nonpoint sources. Accuracy and timeliness of pollutant loading calculations is critical to development of loading estimates used by the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium (NMC) to prepare Tampa Bay Reasonable Assurance (RA) documents. These data also are needed for Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs) and other documents necessary to meet regulatory requirements and for tracking the long-term recovery of the bay (see Action WQ-1).\nAlthough improvements to domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have significantly reduced their water quality impact, they remain a small, but significant source of pollutant loading. In 2015, approximately 122 million gallons of treated wastewater were discharged into Tampa Bay per day. From 2011-2020, industrial and domestic wastewater discharges contributed an average of 5% and 12% of total nitrogen loading to Tampa Bay, respectively.\nAbout a quarter of WWTPs in Florida are authorized to discharge treated wastewater (effluent) directly to surface waters under National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. The remaining plants are authorized to discharge effluent to groundwater through land-application, beneficial use of reclaimed water or deep well injection (see Action WW-1). The Legislature passed a law in 2021 requiring domestic wastewater utilities that dispose of effluent, reclaimed water, or reuse water by surface water discharge to submit a plan for eliminating non-beneficial surface water discharge by January 1, 2032.\nWastewater treatment plants self-monitor and report their own discharges to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) through monthly or quarterly Discharge Monitoring Reports (DMRs), as required by their permits. All permitted facilities are required to monitor and report on the chemical composition of effluent discharges, but the specific parameters they monitor can vary from facility to facility, based on permit requirements. This is particularly problematic for estimating loadings from industrial WWTPs — their permits often require them to only report a subset of nutrient forms (e.g., ionized ammonia, orthophosphate), and often in a way (e.g., without concomitant flow data) that makes it difficult for resource managers to calculate accurate and timely loading estimates for core pollutants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEzDMR\n\n\n\nThe Electronic Discharge Monitoring System (EzDMR) is an electronic reporting tool that saves time and reduces the potential for errors from manual entry of data. It provides instant access to a facility’s current reporting requirements, as well as the status and history of a facility’s reports.]\n\n\nTBEP’s primary interest is consistent reporting of TN to accurately calculate loading estimates for the Reasonable Assurance process. Consistent reporting of TP, TSS and BOD as appropriate would also be helpful.\nAnother challenge to calculating accurate and timely pollutant loading estimates for WWTPs was that facilities traditionally could submit DMRs in hand-written or paper format. This required FDEP to enter data into databases by hand, which took time and could lead to data entry errors and significant lags in reporting data.\nEPA recently promulgated E-reporting rule 80 FR 64063, which requires NPDES permitted facilities to electronically report and share data. This improvement will enhance transparency by providing a timelier, complete, more accurate and nationally consistent set of data in a more accessible form. As of December 2016, FDEP requires all NPDES wastewater and stormwater facilities to submit DMRs through their web-based Electronic Discharge Monitoring Report System (EzDMR). Compliance data from DMRs is accessible to the public through FDEP’s OCULUS website. Locally, the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County also maintains records of DMRs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Expand the beneficial use of reclaimed water\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nEncourage and expand beneficial water reuse to reduce nutrient loadings from wastewater discharges and enhance ecosystem benefits. Track the regional strategy and practices for Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) and direct recharge projects to strengthen understanding of their cumulative effect on ground and surface water quantity and quality. Strengthen understanding of the contribution of nutrients and other constituents from beneficial uses of reclaimed water to Tampa Bay.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Nitrogen load estimates to Tampa Bay from all sources, including reclaimed water, were developed in 1994 and updated in 2001 and 2005. The Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium developed a Nutrient Management Strategy, with regular updates and assessments in 2007, 2009 and 2012 on the nitrogen loading reductions from reclaimed water projects. Estimates of nitrogen loading from irrigation were developed in 2008, leading to recommendations for reduced fertilizer application with reclaimed water irrigation incorporated into the Model Fertilizer Ordinance developed by TBEP. The potential presence, fate and transport of emerging contaminants of concern and microplastics in reclaimed water, wastewater, and other sanitary sewer systems warrants further investigation (see Action COC-4).\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nUse of reclaimed water in the Tampa Bay watershed continues to grow rapidly, with dozens of new projects expected to be online by 2022, reducing the region’s dependence on groundwater while preventing nutrient-rich wastewater effluent from discharging into the bay. New technologies for treating and disposing of wastewater and stormwater are being tested and implemented, continuing to advance the Tampa Bay Area’s national reputation for innovation.\n\n\n\nPasco County plans to use reclaimed water to recharge wetlands, such as these at Crews Lake Wilderness Park. SOURCE: Pasco County\n\n\nReclaimed water can provide a valuable source of freshwater to the bay area — for example, to enhance wetlands, prevent saltwater intrusion into coastal areas or to augment low-salinity habitats identified as important for juvenile fisheries. For that reason, TBEP has encouraged water managers and local governments to retain reclaimed water within the bay watershed.\nTBEP plays an important role in tracking nutrient load reduction from all projects, including reclaimed water initiatives, via the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium’s Action Plan Database. Between 2017-2021, new load reduction projects reduced total nitrogen load by 420.9 tons/yr; about &lt;1% from reuse/reclaimed water projects. The next calculation of nitrogen load reduction throughout the watershed will encompass 2022-2026. Additional planned and budgeted projects are expected to reduce TN loading by 70.5 tons/yr, with 10.5% from reuse and reclaimed projects.\nIn 2015, 38% of the flow from 49 permitted wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in the four-county Tampa Bay region was beneficially reused. Still, in 2015 more than 173 mgd of treated wastewater were released. In 2020, there were 22 reclaimed water projects under development across the 4-county area, including transmission pipelines, pump stations, storage tanks and ponds, aquifer recharge, storage and recovery systems and feasibility studies. These projects could supply an additional 49 mgd of reclaimed water to the region. In its 2020 Regional Water Supply Plan, the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) projected that by 2040 almost 75% of wastewater could be utilized across Pinellas, Pasco, Hillsborough and Manatee Counties.\n\n\nRegional reclaimed water reuse in 2015 and projected reuse by 2040\n(SOURCE: SWFWMD)CountyActual 2015Projected 2040WWTP FlowReuse% ReuseWWTP FlowReuse% ReusePasco29.817.960%40.130.175%Pinellas109.144.841%113.284.975%Hillsborough109.526.624%141.8106.375%Manatee29.915.953%38.328.775%Total278.3105.238%333.325075%\n\n\nAquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) systems have enormous potential for diverting highly treated wastewater flows from disposal into the bay and balancing wet and dry season supply-and-demand inefficiencies. Reclaimed ASR systems inject treated wastewater deep into various underground aquifers, where it is stored in porous rock. From there, it can be pumped back to the surface and distributed for residential, commercial and industrial use. Exploratory wells are drilled to ensure the reclaimed water can be safely stored in the local geologic formations; additional wells drilled around the reclaimed water injection well are monitored for any possible groundwater contamination.\n\n\n\nAquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) injects treated wastewater into an isolated aquifer during the rainy season and pumps it out for reuse during dry season. SOURCE: WaterInnEU Marketplace\n\n\nThere are several reclaimed water ASR facilities in the Tampa Bay Area, with two more under development by the cities of Oldsmar and Palmetto. Some recharge wells, when drilled near the coast with the right geologic conditions, can slow and potentially stop saltwater intrusion into the aquifer. For example, the South Hillsborough Aquifer Recharge Project (SHARP) is a pilot project designed to inject 2 mgd of highly treated reclaimed water into several wells in the Apollo Beach area to create a barrier to saltwater intrusion.\nWith additional treatment, reclaimed water can be injected directly to recharge the aquifer. The Clearwater Replenishment Project will use state-of-the-art treatment technology to purify 2.4 mgd of wastewater to exceed drinking water standards, then inject it into a brackish water zone below the fresh water zone of the Upper Florida Aquifer.\nThe City of Tampa, which produces approximately 58 mgd of Advanced Wastewater Treated (AWT) effluent on an average annual basis, has considered several strategies to store and recover reclaimed water in the Floridan aquifer for subsequent delivery to the Hillsborough River system.\nAnother method for “recycling” wastewater is by indirect aquifer recharge. Treated wastewater is released above ground to spray fields or to treatment and infiltration basins, typically man-made ponds or wetlands, where it can percolate back into groundwater. Pasco County relies primarily on spray-fields and rapid infiltration basins (RIBs); the county is conducting ongoing feasibility studies and planning for an innovative wetland recharge area in central Pasco County. In this public-private partnership among SWFWMD, Pasco County and land owners, wastewater effluent will be biologically treated and infiltrated through a series of constructed wetlands to reduce nutrient concentrations from 9 to 1 mg/L total nitrogen.\nThe City of Tampa conducted a feasibility study incorporating the use of RIBs and ASR wells for delivering AWT wastewater from the City of Tampa’s Howard F. Curren wastewater treatment plant to wetland areas along the Tampa Bypass Canal. From there, the water would seep into the ground and eventually into the Tampa Bypass Canal, potentially increasing water available for pumping into the Hillsborough River Reservoir.\n\n\n\nMore than 200 golf courses in West Central Florida are irrigated with reclaimed water. SOURCE: Manatee County\n\n\nAnother potential use of reclaimed water is piping it from densely populated coastal areas to inland areas for reuse and/or recharge. For example, in 2016 the City of Bradenton completed a project to transfer 100% (5.57 mgd) of its reclaimed water to Lakewood Ranch for landscape irrigation — reducing direct surface water discharge in Manatee County by 90%. Similarly, there are opportunities to interconnect coastal WWTP utilities with spray fields and RIBs in eastern Pasco and Hillsborough Counties.\nThe City of St. Petersburg is designing an innovative wastewater reuse project at its Southwest Wastewater Reclamation Facility. The facility is being restructured to consolidate and treat biosolids, creating an alternative to traditional disposal and land application of this wastewater treatment byproduct. Biosolids will be transformed into higher fertilizer-grade biosolids suitable for sale in gardening centers. Bio-gas from the treatment process will be captured, cleansed and compressed for use on-site and as vehicle fuel.\n\n\n\nSt. Petersburg’s Southwest WWTP is producing fertilizer from bio-solids and fuel from bio-gas generated by the treatment process.\n\n\nMost reclaimed water construction projects include educational components that promote the value and benefits of efficient and effective water management. SWFWMD and local government utilities provide outreach to homeowners, school facility managers, government buildings, parks and open spaces, hospitals and golf courses on the proper application and maintenance of reclaimed water systems for landscaped areas. SWFWMD has a well-developed web page on water reclamation and reuse information, including GIS and other data, as well as educational publications. The Pinellas County South Cross Bayou Water Reclamation Facility and the St. Petersburg facilities offer tours and educational programming.\nThe Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ Program, delivered by UF/IFAS County Extension offices throughout the region, emphasizes water conservation and efficient use of alternative water sources for watering. Additional education is needed to inform residents, golf course and property managers that fertilizer application can be reduced or eliminated where reclaimed water is used for irrigation. This message was a key theme of TBEP’s Be Floridian fertilizer education campaign. Pinellas County currently provides an online map of reclaimed water service areas, with corresponding fertilizer recommendations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Implement the nutrient management strategy for Tampa Bay\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to implement the nutrient management strategy for Tampa Bay to maintain water quality necessary to support seagrass at or above target levels. Document trends in water quality and track nutrient reduction and prevention actions within the watershed. Develop and implement nutrient criteria recommendations and management strategies for the bay’s tidal streams.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) continues to maintain the Nitrogen Reduction Action Plan Database and prepare Reasonable Assurance documentation for water quality requirements. TBEP further supported: 1) establishment of estimates for atmospheric deposition to Tampa Bay watershed sub basins and waters, 2) establishment of estimates of nitrogen loading from residential fertilizer and irrigation and corresponding nutrient load reductions associated with fertilizer restrictions and 3) development of numeric nutrient criteria recommendations for Tampa Bay.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nControlling nitrogen input into the bay as a means to regain vital seagrass beds has been one of TBEP’s most prominent initiatives. Seagrasses were selected as a metric by which efforts to improve the bay are measured because of their overall importance as a bay habitat and nursery, and because they are an important barometer of water quality.\n\n\n\nBecause seagrass requires clear water to flourish, it is a valuable indicator of water quality in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: Jimmy White\n\n\nIn 1995, TBEP adopted a goal of restoring seagrass to 1950 levels after decades of decline (Robison et al. 2020). Reaching this goal required collaboration from local governments, industries, and citizens to reduce nutrients throughout the watershed. The nationally recognized Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium (TBNMC) — an alliance of more than 45 local governments, regulatory agencies and key industries bordering the bay — played a leading role in reducing nitrogen loadings in the bay. TBNMC members developed voluntary water quality and nutrient loading targets to support TBEP’s seagrass recovery goals.\n\nRobison, D., T. Ries, J. Saarinen, D. Tomasko, and and C. Sciarrino. 2020. “Tampa Bay Estuary Program: 2020 Habitat Master Plan Update.” 07-20. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hp0l_qtbxp1JxKJoGatdyuANSzQrpL0I/view?usp=drivesdk.\nBetween 1992 and 2021, this partnership implemented 496 nitrogen load reduction projects through a combined $836 million investment that precluded 950.3 tons/year of nitrogen (TN) from entering Tampa Bay. Baywide nutrient loads declined and water clarity improved to the equivalent of the 1950s period and seagrass coverage reached a peak of 41,655 acres in 2016, surpassing the revised restoration goal of 40,000 acres. By 2022, the bay had only 30,137 acres of seagrasses, a significant decrease of 11,518 acres even though water quality standards were met in all bay segments except Old Tampa Bay. TBEP and partners will reassess the assimilative capacity for nitrogen, beginning with the Old Tampa Bay segment, continue to investigate major drivers causing this loss (see WQ-3), and continue to make significant investments towards implementing projects.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaywide seagrass coverage versus management goal of 40,000 acres.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) approved a regulatory Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Tampa Bay; in 2007, EPA required all permitted nutrient sources within the Tampa Bay watershed to adhere to annual numeric loading limits, or allocations, for their nitrogen discharge to Tampa Bay. The TBNMC proactively developed voluntary nitrogen loading limits for themselves and submitted those limits as recommended allocations to EPA and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP), rather than relying on the regulatory agencies to develop the limits for them. Both EPA and FDEP encouraged and participated in this effort, which was led by TBEP.\n\n\n\nSources of nitrogen loading to Tampa Bay, 1970s versus current\n\n\nAs outlined in the 2009 and 2012 Tampa Bay Reasonable Assurance documents, TBNMC members developed fair and equitable allocations for all 189 permitted sources within the watershed that total the federally-recognized TMDL for Tampa Bay. Consequently, both FDEP and EPA accepted the recommended allocations as meeting water quality requirements for Tampa Bay. In 2011, the TBNMC further developed recommended numeric nutrient criteria consistent with the bay’s nutrient loading targets, which were subsequently adopted by the State in 2012.\n\n\n\nScreenshot for TBEP Action Plan Database for tracking nitrogen management projects by Nitrogen Management Consortium Partners.\n\n\nThe Tampa Bay nutrient management strategy has become a national and international model for successful watershed management collaborations. TBNMC success has utilized a multifaceted approach to reduce nutrient impacts to the bay, including stormwater treatment (see Action SW-10), wastewater reuse and aquifer recharge (see Action WW-1), septic conversions and reduction in sewer overflows (see Actions WW-2, WW-3 and WW-5), reduction in fertilizer use (see Action SW-8), process improvements for industrial manufacturing and power plants (see Action AD-1), habitat rehabilitation and restoration (see Action BH-1) and homeowner education (see Action SW-1).\nExamples (with corresponding reduction in Total Nitrogen, TN, where available) include:\n\nStormwater treatment projects such as the City of Clearwater’s Cliff Stephens Park Stormwater Retrofit Project (5.8 tons/yr TN reduction)\nAtmospheric deposition reduction projects such as Tampa Electric Company’s repowering of Gannon Power Plant Bayside (1.9 tons/yr TN reduction)\nIndustrial manufacturing process upgrades such as those at CF Industries (now Mosaic) Bartow Phosphate Complex (18 tons/yr TN reduction)\nAgricultural water and fertilizer reductions such as citrus and row crop conversion to micro-irrigation in Hillsborough County (2 tons/yr TN reduction)\nWastewater discharge to reuse such as Hillsborough County’s South County Reuse System (17.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nRegional restoration and stormwater treatment creation such as Southwest Florida Water Management District’s Cockroach Bay Restoration Project (0.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nOverlay districts requiring additional stormwater treatment such as Manatee County’s Development and Agricultural Overlay District in the Lake Manatee watershed (9.6 tons/yr TN reduction)\nResidential fertilizer ordinances restricting the use of nitrogen fertilizer during the rainy season adopted by Pinellas County, Manatee County, and cities of St. Petersburg, Clearwater and Tampa (an estimated 6% reduction in TN stormwater runoff)\nStream and creek rehabilitation such as Pinellas County’s Allen’s Creek Rehabilitation Project (0.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nLake sediment rehabilitation such as the City of St. Petersburg’s Lake Maggiore Dredging Project (1.7 tons/yr TN reduction)\nPoint discharge to deep well injection such as Tropicana’s Deep Well Injection Project (11 tons/yr TN reduction)\nEducation campaigns addressing homeowner actions to reduce stormwater runoff such as UF/IFAS Extension’s Florida Friendly Landscaping™ and TBEP’s Be Floridian campaign.\n\n\n\n\nWater quality sampling sites in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: EPCHC\n\n\nPeriodic assessments of the bay’s condition using nutrient-related metrics are now required by FDEP for TBEP partners and the TBNMC. These reporting requirements include annual water quality reports and 5-year Reasonable Assurance (RA) demonstrations that assure that the Tampa Bay Nutrient Management Strategy continues to meet state and federal water quality requirements. Reporting elements in the RA document include 5-year nitrogen loadings from all sources, compliance assessments with approved allocations, water quality trends in each bay segment, and identification of current and future actions to reduce nutrient loadings to Tampa Bay.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Water Quality Report Card summarizes the thousands of water quality records from EPCHC to simply convey the status of each bay segment relative to management targets and regulatory thresholds\n\n\n\n\nWater quality and seagrass conditions in Old Tampa Bay fell below goals during the 2017-2021 RA period. Since hydrologically normalized TN loads are being met, but chl-a exceedances and seagrass losses are still occurring, the TBNMC will reassess the assimilative capacity of Old Tampa Bay. Furthermore, TBEP and Consortium partners continue to implement habitat restoration, stormwater infrastructure, and point source improvement projects focused in Old Tampa Bay and throughout the Tampa Bay watershed that cumulatively contribute to the bay’s overall ecological improvement. The next Tampa Bay RA report, which covers the 2022-2026 period, is due to FDEP by December 2027. Additional planned and budgeted projects are expected to reduce TN loading by 70.5 tons per year.\nEfforts to implement a similar nutrient management strategy in Tampa Bay tidal streams are underway (see Action BH-9). Ongoing research includes development of environmental indicators and thresholds of tidal stream health and nursery function to protect wetland systems against nutrient impairment and a management framework for their restoration (Wessel et al. 2021). This framework establishes proactive metrics that can be utilized by partners to implement watershed restoration actions that can reduce nutrient inputs to tidal streams. An open science tidal tributaries dashboard shows a screening-level evaluation of water quality for 225 creeks. Research explores the relationship between nutrient dynamics and tidal stream condition, advancing regional knowledge of these important low-salinity habitats, as well as informing and prioritizing management actions that may be needed to protect or enhance the ecology of these systems.\n\nWessel, M.

    "text": "Expand use of Green Infrastructure practices\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nPromote expanded use of Green Infrastructure practices to prevent and reduce nitrogen pollution. Promote development and delivery of tools and incentives to expand low impact/green infrastructure implementation, including: professional training; compatibility reviews of local government development codes and comprehensive plans; and demonstration sites. Encourage Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) partners to submit local projects that implement innovative building or site design techniques to the Action Plan Database of the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium. Encourage adoption and implementation of regional policies facilitating low impact/green infrastructure development.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nRevised from previous SW-10 Design and Implement a Low Impact Development Strategy.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nHistorically, stormwater management in Florida focused on rapidly removing rainwater from the built environment to avoid flooding. High volumes of polluted runoff were routed to the nearest receiving water body through extensive networks of gutters, ditches, canals and pipes. This management approach often resulted in polluted waterways, impacts to fish, wildlife and habitats and loss of economic and recreational opportunities that depend on healthy waters.\n\n\n\nThe Straz Center for the Performing Arts was the first building in Tampa with a green roof. It is located on the second level of Ferguson Hall. SOURCE: Straz Center\n\n\nFlorida Law requires that all new and redevelopment projects manage the first inch of rainfall onsite rather than discharging to storm drains. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) and the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) have determined that Environmental Resource Permit (ERP) applicants for new construction discharges in the Tampa Bay watershed must meet more stringent standards by demonstrating net improvement (i.e., no degradation) to waterways, because Tampa Bay is not meeting all water quality standards in all areas of the bay.\nCommunities across Florida are now replacing outdated stormwater management systems with more innovative ones that can simultaneously reduce flooding while protecting the natural environment. These practices may also advance beneficial uses of reclaimed water (see Action WW-1) and comprehensive management of water resources within the watershed.\nGreen Infrastructure practices (also known as Low Impact Development or Low Impact Design) reduce and treat stormwater at its source, minimizing the volume of water and pollution discharged from the built environment. At the city or county scale, Green Infrastructure is a patchwork of natural areas that provides habitat, flood protection, cleaner air and cleaner water. At the neighborhood or site scale, green stormwater management systems mimic nature by soaking up and storing water, thereby reducing flow of pollutants to water bodies.\n\nEXAMPLES OF GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNIQUES:\n\nPervious surfaces for parking areas, walkways, and drives can reduce runoff from small rain events, allowing gradual infiltration into underlying soils. Pervious surfaces include pavers, bricks, gravel, shell and porous concretes.\nRetention areas like rain gardens, vegetated swales and recessed tree islands are small depressions designed to capture runoff and allow it to evaporate or percolate into the ground. Associated vegetation can take up water and nutrients.\nVegetative buffers and littoral zones around shorelines, ponds and waterways can filter pollutants and litter from runoff before it enters a waterbody. Specifically, biological communities (including bacteria) provide valuable nutrient removal services. Harvestable floating vegetated islands can increase the effective area over which plants can remove nutrient pollution from conventional detention ponds (see Action BH-6).\nRainwater harvesting systems, such as rain barrels and cisterns, can capture rainfall and store it for later use.\nCanopy trees and green roofs can intercept rainfall before it hits the ground. A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study found that for every 10 percent increase in tree cover (up to 60%), water treatment costs decreased by approximately 20 percent (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2007).\n\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2007. “Reducing Stormwater Costs Through Low Impact Development (LID) Strategies and Practices.” EPA 841-F-07-006.

An analysis of 17 case studies across the United States reported a 15 to 80 percent cost savings over conventional stormwater methods, with only a few exceptions.1 Many benefits were not monetized in this review, including improvements to water quality, human and environmental health, recreational opportunities, aesthetic value, property value, natural habitat and quality of life. Consideration of these broader watershed-scale benefits is important to evaluating the overall cost-benefits of Green Infrastructure applied on a parcel or local scale and is an important area for more research.\nA variety of barriers exist to implementing Green Infrastructure, including lack of awareness of techniques; lack of accurate information about costs and benefits; limited opportunities for technical training and practice; homeowner association rules and deed restrictions; and outdated language in development codes and comprehensive plans that impede innovative practices. For example, a 2014 review of Hillsborough County construction and development codes identified a variety of provisions that discouraged, limited or otherwise prevented the use of low-impact development techniques (Tetratech 2014).\n\nTetratech. 2014. “Summary of Green Infrastructure Inconsistencies and Barriers in Codes and Guidance with Action Items for Hillsborough County.” 08-14.

K. Ruppert, and M. J. Kipp. 2008. “Protecting Florida’s Water Quality: Identifying and Overcoming Barriers to Implementation of Low Impact Development (LID) Practices.” Gainesville, Florida: University of Florida Water Institute.\nA survey of Florida developers, professionals and government officials identified potential strategies for overcoming some of these barriers (Clark et al. 2008), including:\n\nEducation, outreach and marketing to the building community and public;\nLand development code and comprehensive plan language amendments;\nIncentives for advanced stormwater treatment, such as integrating stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) with open space and landscape code requirements;\nResearch and demonstration projects;\nProfessional training for both public and private sector representatives responsible for design and review of stormwater systems.\n\nThe stormwater regulatory environment in Florida is slowly evolving to encourage and facilitate adoption of Green Infrastructure principles and techniques.\nFDEP drafted a new Statewide Stormwater Treatment Rule in 2010, which was never adopted. The effort was renewed with a new series of rule-making workshops in 2022 and 2023. If adopted, it would be the first update since the original 1982 rule. The draft rule proposes to increase the level of nutrient removal required from stormwater treatment systems serving new development, such that post-development nutrient loads do not exceed loads from comparable natural, undeveloped areas. The draft rule aims to create a unified statewide standard supporting the underlying objectives of low-impact development.\nThe Florida Legislature adopted a statewide ERP Rule (Chapter 62-330, F.A.C.) in 2013. A new two-volume Applicant’s Manual accompanies the Rule. Applicant’s Handbook Volume I is applicable statewide and provides general background and summaries of relevant statutes, rules, types of permits, system operation and maintenance and other general topics. Applicant’s Handbook Volume II contains Water Management District-specific design and performance criteria for stormwater quantity, quality, flood control and other special basin-specific criteria. The new ERP Rule and accompanying Applicant’s Manuals require that new stormwater management systems that discharge directly or indirectly into impaired waters must provide net improvement for the pollutants that contribute to the water body’s impairment. To do this, a higher level of treatment is necessary to assure that the permit creates a net environmental benefit. However, in many cases, redevelopment is often exempt from the stricter stormwater treatment standards, for all or part of the redeveloped property.\n\n\n\nVegetative shorelines help filter and treat runoff entering stormwater ponds.\n\n\nAdopted in 2017 and revised in 2021, Pinellas County’s new stormwater manual is designed to be used in conjunction with the Pinellas County Comprehensive Plan and Land Development Code. Recognizing that Pinellas County is almost entirely built-out, the manual and revised development codes incorporate a variety of Green Infrastructure techniques especially appropriate to redevelopment, adaptive reuse and retrofits. Hillsborough County adopted a stormwater manual in 2021. The TBEP, in partnership with the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council, is planning a two-phase project in 2024 to develop a multi-jurisdictional stormwater master plan in the Old Tampa Bay watershed and implement high priority stormwater retrofits to reduce nonpoint source nutrient loads in the region.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Reduce pollution from recreational boaters\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to promote marina, boatyard and boater education and best practices. Increase availability of sewage pumpout stations and mobile pumpout vessels. Encourage creation of appropriately sited mooring fields near sewage pumpout facilities or services. Encourage enforcement of rules prohibiting sewage discharges, especially for liveaboards and unmaintained vessels outside of marinas or mooring fields. Survey and identify problem areas for unregulated liveaboards. Support state and local programs to remove derelict vessels.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nMoved from Action WQ-2 and revised to focus on waste management issues associated with recreational boats.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nPollution resulting from improper boating practices includes sewage discharges, release of toxic chemicals, oil and fuel spills, stormwater runoff from marinas and boatyards, abandoned and derelict vessels, marine debris and discarded monofilament line or other fishing gear. This action focuses on the need for additional sewage pumpout services for marinas, identification and management of liveaboards, removal of derelict vessels and continued education about clean boating practices for boaters, marinas and mooring fields. Other boating impacts (such as handling of waste and monofilament line, and safe operation in manatee and seagrass areas) are addressed elsewhere in the CCMP (see Actions PE-1, PA-1, BH-3 and FW-1).\n\n\n\nRemoval of derelict vessels is often a lengthy and costly process for state and local agencies.\n\n\nMore than 150,000 boats are registered in Hillsborough, Manatee, Pasco and Pinellas Counties, according to the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles. The number of registered vessels in the Tampa Bay area grew by fifteen percent between 2016 and 2022 with Manatee County registrations increasing by forty-three percent. Pinellas County ranked second and Hillsborough County fifth in number of registered boats statewide in 2022. The vast majority of these boats are 16 to 26 feet long. The popularity of recreational boating highlights the need for baywide adoption of responsible boating practices to protect water quality, human health and aquatic habitats.\n\n\nFlorida Boat Registrations by County for 2016 and 2022.

These voluntary recognition and designation programs provide no-cost assistance to marinas and boatyards in implementing Best Management Practices to protect sensitive habitats, manage waste and stormwater, prevent spills and prepare for emergencies. There are 45 designated Clean Marinas or Clean Boatyards in the Tampa Bay region.\nDischarging raw sewage into waterways threatens environmental and human health. The Clean Vessel Act of 1992 prohibits discharge of sewage into Florida’s inland and offshore waters extending nine miles out into the Gulf of Mexico. Boaters must legally store sewage generated onboard using an approved treatment device or holding tank and use an authorized waste dump receptacle, pumpout facility or pumpout vessel to permanently dispose of waste when in port.\nPermits for new marinas and mooring fields, or renovations to existing ones, do not automatically require pumpout facilities or pumpout vessels. They are typically required, however, if the proposed marina or mooring field includes slips for liveaboards, or there are water quality issues in the area. Clean Marinas are encouraged, but not required, to provide pumpout facilities. As of summer 2017, pumpout facilities are available at 55 marinas in the four coastal counties of Tampa Bay, and 26 of these are Clean Marinas.\nThe Clean Vessel Act established a grant program administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which provides funding for purchase, installation, maintenance, repair and operation of boater pumpout and dump stations. The City of Clearwater purchased a pumpout vessel with Clean Vessel Act funding and provides mobile pumpout services one day a week. Facilities receiving funding from the Act must make pumpout services available to the public for free, or for a nominal charge. As of December 2015, the Act has prevented more than 20 million gallons of sewage from contaminating Florida waterways.\n\n\n\nMarinas with pumpout facilities in theTampa Bay Region. Designated Clean Marinas are encouraged but not required to provide pumpout stations. SOURCE: FDEP\n\n\nIncreasing access to authorized waste disposal receptacles and pumpout facilities and improving boater understanding about the legal, environmental and human health consequences of illegal sewage discharges are important strategies to reduce sewage pollution from recreational boaters.\nSpecial attention is required to identify and address illegal sewage discharges from liveaboards and unmaintained vessels outside of regulated marinas and mooring fields. A unified, shared spatial database of liveaboards or unmaintained boats across the Tampa Bay Area is needed to better understand the distribution and abundance of these vessels in the area and to prioritize management actions (e.g., enforcement, relocation to marinas, creation of regulated mooring fields or additional pump out vessels to service these locations) at local trouble spots. Enforcement action is hampered by difficulties in catching violators in the act. Trouble spots may include areas around Hurricane Hole, Terra Ceia, Williams Park Boat Ramp, Clearwater Memorial Causeway and Davis Island Boat Ramp. Increasing the availability or capacity of appropriately sited mooring fields may reduce illegal sewage discharges by aggregating boats in managed areas with adjacent or mobile pumpout services.\nAbandoned and derelict vessels can cause environmental damage by physically impacting sensitive marine and coastal habitats (see Action BH-4) or by discharging sewage, oil, toxic chemicals and marine debris.\n\n\n\nA baywide inventory of liveaboards is needed to assist in identifying “hotspots” for sewage discharge. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nVessels can be classified by law enforcement as “derelict” if they are “left, stored, or abandoned in a wrecked, junked, or substantially dismantled condition upon any public waters of this state, at any port in this state without the consent of the agency having jurisdiction thereof, or docked or grounded at or beached upon the property of another without the consent of the owner of the property.” Severe storms, such as hurricanes, are often a catalyst for the creation of additional derelict vessels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFlorida law defines a vessel at risk of becoming derelict as:\n\nOne that is taking on or has taken on water without an effective means to get the water out;\nOne with spaces that are designed to be enclosed but are incapable of being sealed off or remain open to the elements for extended periods of time;\nOne that has broken loose or is in danger of breaking loose from its anchor;\nOne that is left or stored aground unattended in such a condition to prevent the vessel from getting underway, or;\nOne that is listing due to water intrusion, or is sunk or partially sunk.\n\n\n\nIt is unlawful in Florida to store, leave or abandon any derelict vessel in state waters. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) or any law enforcement agency can relocate or remove any derelict vessel in the state and the vessel owner is liable for all costs. However, the time between initial identification of a derelict vessel and its eventual removal can be a long and drawn-out process, and removal is costly. In 2021, the Legislature passed a new law that empowers law enforcement to take action on at-risk vessels. For 2022, the Florida Legislature allocated $8.3 million for derelict vessel removal statewide. Hillsborough County owns its own salvage equipment for derelict vessel removal. Pinellas pays a per-foot removal fee to a contracted marine salvage company, with costs covered by the county’s share of boat registration fees.\nThe FWC’s At-Risk Vessel Program allows law enforcement agents to identify vessels at risk of becoming derelict, before they become a problem. Law enforcement officers can tag these vessels and issue violation notices to owners who refuse to improve a vessel’s seaworthiness and secure mooring or storage. At-risk vessels are tracked in a statewide database.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Continue assessments of human and environmental health indicators suitable for Tampa Bay beaches and other recreational waters\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nSupport and monitor research into microbial indicators of waterborne pathogens harmful to human and environmental health. Support and monitor advancements in analytical techniques to directly detect, identify and track waterborne microbial pathogens. Support adoption of best available detection, identification and source tracking methodologies. Increase public education and awareness about waterborne fecal pathogens, beach advisories and best practices to reduce public exposure.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Action revised from Action PH-2 Continue source and risk assessments of human and ecosystem health indicators suitable for subtropical marine beaches and waters.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTampa Bay Area beaches and recreational waters are nationally recognized for their outstanding natural beauty. They provide recreational opportunities to residents and visitors alike, and support Tampa Bay’s diverse economy, especially its recreation and tourism industries. Maintaining suitable water quality at beaches and other recreational waters is foundational to protecting Tampa Bay’s environment and economy.\n\n\n\nThe Healthy Beaches Program regularly monitors public beaches around the bay for bacterial contamination.\n\n\nWaterborne microbial pathogens (pathogenic microbes) occur naturally in the bay, but many locations experience fecal contamination periodically from various sources including sewer overflows, domestic livestock, pets and humans (see Actions PH-4, PH-5, WW-2, WW-3 and WW-5). Early detection of pathogenic microbes is critical to public health and to public confidence in monitoring and risk assessments of health threats.\nBacteria, viruses and protozoa can cause a variety of human illnesses ranging in severity from rashes, ear, nose and throat infections and diarrhea to antibiotic-resistant infections, cholera and typhoid fever. Some naturally occurring bacteria (e.g. Vibrio vulnificus) may also pose human health concerns for those who consume raw seafood or have suppressed immune systems. Increasing water temperatures due to climate change may enhance susceptibility to these bacterial infections and facilitate the introduction of potential new pathogens from tropical environments.\n\n\n\nThe harmful bacteria Vibrio vulnificus is transmitted by eating raw or undercooked shellfish or swimming in saltwater with an open wound. Photo from the Centers for Disease Control. SOURCE: Centers for Disease Control\n\n\nFecal coliform bacteria, especially Escherichia coli (E. coli) are widely used as indicators for waterborne pathogens. Coliform bacteria occur naturally in animal feces, and when detected in high concentrations may indicate the presence of co-occurring harmful pathogens. However, because they are present in the feces of a wide variety of animals, they do not pinpoint human sources of contamination. Moreover, Florida’s subtropical climate allows fecal coliforms to grow and multiply naturally in the environment. These shortcomings can reduce the consistent predictive value of the presence of coliform bacteria as an indicator of more harmful pathogens and their threats to human health.\nA study of alternative, more accurate indicators of pathogens sponsored by the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) and Pinellas County identified enterococci bacteria (Enteroccocus species) as the best fecal indicator bacteria for subtropical marine waters (Rose et al. 2001), because 1) they have a greater correlation with water-related gastrointestinal illness in both marine and freshwater than other fecal indicator bacteria, and 2) they can survive longer in saltwater. However, because enterococci bacteria are shed in feces of all warm-blooded animals, they cannot be used to pinpoint human contamination sources. The study ultimately recommended the use of enterococci, along with fecal coliform bacteria, while proposing source tracking of fecal coliform to fingerprint the types of bacteria originating from human sources.\n\nRose, J. B., J. H. Paul, M. R. McLaughlin, V. J. Harwood, S.Farrah, M.Tamplin, and G.Lukasik. 2001. “Healthy Beaches Tampa Bay: Microbiological Monitoring of Water Quality Conditions and Public Health Impacts.” 03-01. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/12cfmGcr1u_W7j5nf12D9O6X0H4fVUtgC/view?usp=drivesdk.\nCurrently, both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) use E. coli as an indicator of bacterial contamination in freshwater systems, and enterococci for marine waters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBecause of the importance of water quality to local economies many counties and municipalities assumed responsibility for performing their own beach water testing when the state reduced funding for monitoring.\n\n\nArea county health departments collect water samples weekly at area beaches and analyze them for enterococci and fecal coliform bacteria. City and county water quality departments assist in collecting these samples. Area health departments issue advisories or warnings when conditions warrant, although a consistent link between exposure to indicator organisms and public health risk remains elusive.\n\n\n\nBeaches monitored for water quality in the Tampa Bay Area. SOURCE: FDOH Florida Healthy Beaches Program\n\n\nAlthough great gains in protecting public health have been made using fecal indicator bacteria, viral pathogens may actually cause a significant portion of waterborne illness. Because viruses and bacteria respond differently to water treatment processes and environmental degradation, traditional fecal indicator bacteria may not be good indicators for their presence. Research into bacteriophages, or viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria, hold promise for developing better indicators of viral pathogens. EPA suggested that coliphages (viruses that infect and replicate within E. coli) may be better indicators of viruses in fecal contamination and may yield more accurate methodologies for evaluating water quality and protecting public health (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2015).\n\nU.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2015. “Review of Coliphages as Possible Indicators of Fecal Contamination for Ambient Water Quality.” EPA-820-R-15-098. Washington, D.C.: Unites States Environmental Protection Agency. https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-07/documents/review_of_coliphages_as_possible_indicators_of_fecal_contamination_for_ambient_water_quality.pdf.\nAdvances in direct pathogen identification methodologies coupled with microbial source tracking may soon revolutionize water quality analysis for human health risks. Locally, the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) is funding a microbial source tracking study of fecal contamination in the Bullfrog Creek/Sweetwater Creek watersheds. Results will help pinpoint specific sources and inform reduction or prevention strategies.\nNew methodologies can now detect and identify the genetic material from multiple pathogens in water samples (Li et al. 2015). This direct, multi-target approach has the added benefit of eliminating false negatives (i.e., concluding waters are safe, when they may not be) from measuring the wrong indicator or pathogen.\n\nLi, X., V.

    "text": "Address hot spots of sediment contamination in the bay\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nIdentify and remediate priority “hot spots” of sediment contamination in the bay. Continue sediment quality and benthic monitoring in the bay and expand to tidal tributaries and rivers. Incorporate benthic community targets in management plans.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Using the Tampa Bay Benthic Index, eight priority hot spots were identified in Tampa Bay. A Sediment Quality Action Plan was developed for the highest priority site, McKay Bay, and initial assessment has been completed.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMonitoring of benthic, or bottom, habitats has been ongoing since 1993 with more than 1,500 samples analyzed for environmental contamination, including chemical and physical indicators and biological indicators like benthic community composition. The Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) coordinates the Tampa Bay Benthic Monitoring Program with participation from Manatee and Pinellas Counties.\n\n\n\nScientists prepare to sift through a sample of bay sediment to look for benthic invertebrates.\n\n\nOver the last 20 years, the condition of Tampa Bay benthic communities baywide has been “Fair” to “Poor”, with “Good” conditions in Middle and Lower Tampa Bay in most years and lower trending scores in Old Tampa Bay and Hillsborough Bay. Based on these long term monitoring data, increased benthic monitoring of major river systems (e.g., Hillsborough, Palm, Alafia and Little Manatee Rivers) and minor tidal tributaries is needed (see Action BH-8), and benthic community indicators and targets should be incorporated into tidal stream habitat management plans (see Actions BH-1 and BH-9).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBenthic monitoring is important for identifying hot spots of sediment contamination. Using monitoring data, the Tampa Bay Benthic Index (TBBI) provides a tool for assessing the health of benthic habitats. This index assesses the severity of contamination based on lack of diversity or abundance of benthic organisms, low dissolved oxygen or high levels of contaminants of concern (COCs). COCs include toxic chemicals like heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenols (PCBs) and organic pesticides. Because COCs can persist for decades in aquatic sediments and some can bioaccumulate in the food web, these hot spots pose health risks to fish, wildlife and humans.\n\n\nSediment Contaminants of Concern for Priority Areas of Tampa Bay.\nSOURCE: TBEPPesticidesPCBsHPAHsMetalsUpper Hillsborough BayxxxxLower Hillsborough BayxxMcKay BayxxxBoca Ciega BayxxBayboro HarborxxxAdjacent to BayboroxxWestern Old Tampa Bayxxx\n\n\nIn 2007, the Sediment Quality Assessment Group identified eight priority “hot spot” areas in Tampa Bay with low TBBI scores, indicating elevated contamination and reduced benthic diversity. These are:\n\nMcKay Bay\nEast Bay\nYbor Channel\nWest Davis Island\nLargo Inlet\nWestshore\nBayboro Harbor/Port of St. Petersburg\nApollo Beach/Big Bend\n\n\n\n\nPriority areas of sediment contamination in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nThrough a cooperative effort of TBEP partners, a Sediment Quality Action Plan (SQAP) was developed in 2011 for the highest-ranking hotspot, McKay Bay, where 46% of benthic sediments are contaminated by PAHs, PCBs and metals in concentrations high enough to threaten the organisms living in the bay. Despite its urban location and impacted sediments, McKay Bay provides important wildlife habitat with its diversity of mudflats, mangroves, saltmarshes and oyster bars. The McKay Bay SQAP recommends initial steps to 1) identify and control external sources of COCs from upland sites with known soil or groundwater contamination and from stormwater runoff, and 2) assess ecological and human health risks from contaminated sediments.\n\n\n\nEcosystem impacts from contaminated sediments can manifest across the food web from planktonic organisms and benthic infauna to fish and birds who feed on them. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nFollow-up studies in 2014, funded by the Tampa Bay Environmental Restoration Fund, showed McKay Bay sediments are toxic to some animals. In tests of a variety of fish and shellfish, PAHs found in clam tissues exceeded U.S. Environmental Protection Agency thresholds for ecological effects in some areas; and two PAHs found in test animal tissue exceeded EPA screening levels for human health of subsistence fishers at all McKay Bay sites. These results highlight the need for continuing risk assessments and tracking of updated standards. The last baywide risk assessment for COCs was published in 1995.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Continue to reduce nitrogen loading from atmospheric deposition\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to support power plant upgrades and transitions to alternate energy sources. Continue to support initiatives to reduce atmospheric nitrogen pollution from vehicles. Expand the number of air monitoring stations for atmospheric nitrogen. Support research to better understand and quantify the contribution of atmospheric deposition to stormwater runoff. Support public education about the link between air and water quality.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nRevised Action. Formerly Action AD-1 Continue atmospheric deposition studies to better understand the relationship between air and water quality. Appended with background from former Action AD-2 Promote public and business energy conservation.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nReducing nitrogen input (loading) to Tampa Bay is a core management objective for the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) and its partners (see Action WQ-1). Reductions in nitrogen pollution are linked to improved water quality, recovery of seagrass meadows and associated marine life and other environmental and human health benefits.\n\n\n\nTECO’s 23-megawatt solar array near the Big Bend Power Station is capable of powering more than 3,300 homes. SOURCE: Tampa Electric\n\n\nNitrogen (N) pollution can reach Tampa Bay from a variety of sources, including stormwater runoff from non-point sources (e.g., urban fertilizer runoff or septic systems — see Actions SW-1, SW-8, SW-10, WW-2), point sources (e.g., a wastewater treatment plant — see Actions WW-3 and WW-5), groundwater and springs and atmospheric deposition. Atmospheric nitrogen can reach bay waters directly through deposition from rainfall and dust and indirectly through stormwater runoff carrying atmospheric nitrogen deposited on impervious surfaces in the watershed.\nNitrogen can be emitted to the atmosphere from natural sources, such as manure emissions, forest fires and lightning. In Tampa Bay’s highly urbanized watershed, natural sources are a relatively small contributor to atmospheric nitrogen loading. Most atmospheric nitrogen is emitted from fossil-fuel burning power plants and vehicles.\nTBEP has been a national leader in investigating and quantifying the significant role of airborne nitrogen in overall nitrogen inputs to the bay. The long-term, multi-site bay Region Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (BRACE), completed in 2013, was conducted by scientists from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), University of South Florida, TBEP and other federal, state and local environmental agencies.\nBRACE demonstrated that atmospheric deposition (both directly on the bay’s surface, and indirectly, through stormwater runoff) accounted for 57% of the total annual nitrogen loading to the bay from all sources. This contribution is mainly in the form of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which contribute to ozone, an air pollutant of public health concern in Florida. BRACE showed that atmospheric sources contributed four times as much nitrogen to Tampa Bay as discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants and industry combined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the bulk of emissions generated in the Tampa Bay Area originated from power plants and industry, BRACE demonstrated that emissions from vehicles had a larger local impact. This is likely due to the fact that these emissions are generated low to the ground and tend to stay within the bay watershed, while pollution emitted from tall industrial stacks is dispersed over a much larger airshed that extends north to Atlanta and south to Cuba.\nData collected for BRACE showed that, compared to power plants, vehicles contributed four times more NOx deposition to the Tampa Bay watershed and two times more NOx deposition directly to the bay. The study also reported that two-thirds of atmospheric nitrogen deposition was contained in dust particles (dry deposition) and one-third came with rainfall (wet deposition); and that air pollution from outside the Tampa Bay Area can impact the bay as well.\n\nAn ongoing University of Florida research and IFAS/Extension project aims to better understand and publicly communicate the contribution of atmospheric deposition to N loads in stormwater. The study looks at the potential impact of atmospherically derived N on water quality in the Tampa Bay watershed as it interacts with the urban tree canopy and urban impervious surfaces. Further, researchers are studying how atmospheric N may be utilized by Karenia brevis and Pyrodinium bahamense, the toxic microalgae most responsible for algal problems in Tampa Bay.\nLocal and national regulations are significantly reducing nitrogen emissions and improving air quality in the Tampa Bay Area.\nThe Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) finalized in 2011 by the EPA requires states to improve air quality by reducing power plant emissions that contribute to fine particle pollution and ground-level ozone in downwind states. This rule replaced EPA’s 2005 Clean Air Interstate Rule. Local power plant upgrades, including replacing coal-burning plants with natural gas facilities and installing nitrogen reduction equipment on smoke stacks, resulted in a 95-ton per year decline in nitrogen emissions between 2002 and 2012.\nTampa Electric Company (TECO) replaced its coal-fired Gannon plant at Port Sutton in 2003 with the H.L. Culbreath Bayside Power Station, a 1,800 megawatt natural gas plant. According to TECO, the switch from coal to natural gas reduced nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 99 percent and particulate matter emissions by 93 percent from 1998 levels. TECO also reported that NOx emissions from the 1,700 megawatt, coal-fired Big Bend Power Station in Apollo Beach declined 91 percent from 1998 emission levels by using technology that converts NOx into N\\(_2\\) and water. In 2004, TECO reduced emissions of particulate matter by 87 percent over 1998 levels by optimizing emission control units. In addition, more than $23 million in scrubber upgrades have resulted in a 94 percent reduction of sulfur dioxide levels compared to 1998 levels.\nDuke Energy (formerly Progress Energy) converted its Bartow Power Plant at Weedon Island in 2009 from fuel oil to natural gas, reducing emissions by more than 80 percent, including a 98 percent reduction of sulfur dioxide emissions.\nSince 2001, Florida Power and Light (FPL) has transitioned from burning more oil than any other utility in the nation to having less than 0.1 percent of its electricity generation produced from oil. Locally, FPL added a new natural gas-fueled generator at its Manatee County power plant and converted two existing units to co-fire natural gas and oil.\nBoth TECO and FPL began operating universal solar energy facilities in 2017. FPL’s 74.35-megawatt Manatee Solar Energy Center is among several large-scale facilities completed or planned by the company throughout Florida. The Manatee site houses 338,000 solar panels, enough to cover five football fields.\nTECO launched a 23-megawatt photovoltaic (PV) array with more than 200,000 solar panels near the Big Bend Power Station. The system has the capacity to power more than 3,300 homes.\nDespite its abundant sunshine throughout the year, Florida — the Sunshine State — lags nationally in solar production. In 2016, Florida voters approved a State Constitutional Amendment to provide property tax breaks for people who install solar panels on their homes.\n\n\n\nTECO solar array.\n\n\nAmerica’s fleet of cars and trucks is becoming more energy efficient. New Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards were adopted in 2012, but are currently being reevaluated. Progress continues in developing hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered cars. Sales of battery-powered and plug-in hybrid cars in the U.S. increased by 37% in 2016, to 159,139 vehicles. Meanwhile, the Tampa Bay Area Regional Transit Authority (TBARTA) formed in 2007 to address regional transit needs was dissolved in 2023 .\nMany opportunities exist to promote energy conservation that saves consumers money and reduces NOx emissions. Examples include:\n\nThe EPA’s voluntary Energy Star program helps businesses and individuals save money and protect the environment by identifying and promoting energy efficient products, homes and businesses. Since its inception in 1992, the Energy Star program has helped consumers save $362 billion dollars on utility bills and prevent 2.5 billion tons of greenhouse gasses.\nA variety of rebate programs, free energy audits and other incentive programs are sponsored by local utilities such as TECO, FPL and Duke Energy to increase efficiency of appliances, heat pumps, air conditioning ducts and insulation.\nUF/IFAS Extension provides a wealth of general information about energy efficiency and “living green” including specific information about energy-efficient lighting, heating, cooling and landscaping.\n\nDespite significant reductions in nitrogen emissions from power plants and vehicles and improved energy efficiency of buildings and appliances, rapid population growth in the Tampa Bay Area may offset some of these gains. As population size and energy demand grow, continuing reductions in per capita energy use and air pollution will be needed, especially from vehicles, to maintain and improve the region’s water quality and quality of life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Identify and understand emerging contaminants\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nIdentify sources and understand impacts of contaminants found in pharmaceuticals, personal care products and microplastics. Promote education to reduce pollution from microplastics and emerging contaminants.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nNew Action\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nAquatic environments are the ultimate reservoirs for many man-made chemical contaminants. The toxicity of pesticides and industrial chemicals, such as DDT, chlordane, dieldrin and PCBs, is well documented and their use banned or discontinued decades ago. Nevertheless, they persist in aquatic sediments and bioaccumulate in fish and wildlife in Tampa Bay (see Action COC-1).\n\n\n\nStudents from Eckerd College collect water samples to analyze for microplastics. SOURCE: David Hastings\n\n\nThe presence and potential effects of synthetic or natural endocrine or hormone disruptors is an emerging concern for fish and wildlife, as well as human health in Tampa Bay. Endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) mimic the functions of natural hormones, affecting growth, reproduction and development in aquatic organisms, especially fish. They include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs — used as a flame retardant in clothing, furniture and electronics), perfluorinated and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and bisphenol A (BPA — used to make plastic), which can be acutely toxic to fish and wildlife. Even at low levels these compounds can disrupt hormonal systems over time. Another class of EDCs comes from ethinyl estradiol — a synthetic estrogen used in oral contraceptives — which has been found in aquatic environments downstream of wastewater treatment plants. EDCs are also found in pesticides, insecticides and fungicides.\nAdditionally, a wide variety of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) — including lotions, shampoos, sunscreens, perfumes and cosmetics — contain constituents such as phthalates, parabens, glycol ethers, ultraviolet (UV) filters, polycyclic musks and antimicrobials, that have been linked to adverse endocrine or reproductive effects. Research has documented the presence of these chemical compounds in municipal waste effluent.\nLocally, a 2015 University of South Florida study quantified six estrogen-based EDCs in Tampa Bay Area water, sediment, and sewage influent and effluent (Cook 2015). All targeted EDCs were present in 89% of sewage from sewer plant discharge samples, while 100% of the samples contained at least one or more EDCs. The concentrations of EDCs in water and sediment samples tended to decrease with increasing distance from the wastewater treatment plant discharge site. At present, however, there is great uncertainty surrounding actionable levels of EDCs, and current toxicity testing required of chemical products does not evaluate endocrine-disrupting effects.\n\nCook, M. M. 2015. “Endocrine-Disrupting Compounds: Measurement in Tampa Bay, Removal from Sewage and Development of an Estrogen Receptor Model.” PhD thesis, St. Petersburg, Florida: University of South Florida.\n\nPulster, E. L., K. Rullo, S. Gilbert, T. M. Ash, B. Goetting, K. Campbell, S. A. Markham, and S. A. Murawski. 2022. “Assessing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Sediments and Fishes in a Large, Urbanized Estuary and the Potential Human Health Implications.” Frontiers in Marine Science 9 (11-22): 16. https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.1046667.\nA 2022 study quantified per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in sediments and fish of Tampa Bay and found levels exceeding concentration thresholds for minimum risk levels (Pulster et al. 2022). In a 2023 redfish pharmaceuticals contamination study across nine Florida estuaries conducted by Bonefish Tarpon Trust and FIU, researchers detected 17 unique pharmaceuticals in fish blood plasma. Tampa Bay redfish had on average three different pharmaceuticals, the second highest occurrence in the state. As wastewater infrastructure is updated and upgraded (see WW-5), research is needed to assess the efficacy of various wastewater treatment technologies at removing these contaminants prior to discharge or reuse and to evaluate the ecological and human health implications of indirect reuse to augment groundwater or surface water supplies in the Tampa Bay area.\nMicroplastics are another emerging contaminant of concern in Tampa Bay. Generally between 1-5 millimeters in size, microplastics are small plastic particles usually derived from the breakdown of larger plastic marine debris. Another source is from the direct manufacture of microbeads, such as those found in cleansers and cosmetics. A 2015 Federal Law bans the addition of microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics by July 2017. In Tampa Bay, plastic fragments, including from tire wear, are the most common type of plastic particles (Gowans and Suida 2020). Microbeads and fibers are often too small to be filtered out by most wastewater treatment systems, and are released into the environment with treated wastewater.\n\n\n\nPlastic microbeads in facial scrub. SOURCE: Dave Graft\n\n\nSlow to break down, plastics persist in surface waters and throughout the water column and can become incorporated into organisms and sediments. Fibers can also absorb chemical contaminants and become laden with toxins. Microplastics have been found embedded in the tissue of worms, crustaceans, sea cucumbers and fish through ingestion or respiration and can accumulate in the stomachs of predators. Thus, fish and wildlife can be harmed by physical blockage or damage to the digestive tract, leaching of plastic chemical components into tissues and ingestion and accumulation of toxins adsorbed to the plastic (such as metals, PCBs and PBDEs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n90% of coastal water samples in Florida contain at least one piece of plastic.\n\n\nResearch on the presence of microplastics in Tampa Bay shows an abundance of plastic fragments, with highest concentrations found in Old Tampa Bay and Lower Tampa Bay, near Egmont Key. A TBERF-funded project with Eckerd College standardized methods for collecting, identifying and quantifying microplastics in the environment with specific findings on the abundance, distribution, and ecological interactions of microplastics in Tampa Bay (Gowans and Suida 2020). More information is needed to better understand how microplastics enter waterways, how they are distributed, and what impacts they may have on aquatic organisms.\n\nGowans, S., and A. Suida. 2020. “Microplastics in Tampa Bay: Abundance, Distribution, and Ecological Interactions (2018 TBERF).” 04-21. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/13vFupgf-2DJNHeV2k1j7Lg2FQnaCgell/view?usp=sharing.\nMicroplastics could be sampled as part of monthly water quality sampling for Tampa Bay conducted by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC). Fish tissue samples could be collected to evaluate the presence, types and ecological impacts of microplastics as part of fisheries-independent sampling conducted by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) (see Action FW-5).\n\n\n\nParticipants in a community science workshop learn how to identify and document the presence of microplastics in bay water samples.\n\n\nThe statewide Florida Microplastic Awareness Project, funded by a 2015 NOAA Marine Debris Grant, seeks to train citizen scientists to collect and analyze water samples for microplastics. An important goal of this project is to increase public awareness of how plastics in local waterways are connected to human sources. The program also includes an online pledge for actions that can reduce plastic marine debris. Training workshops using the filtered water sample method were held by Pinellas County UF/IFAS Extension in 2016 and 2017, including training for the UF/IFAS Florida Water Stewardship Program and a Pinellas County-wide workshop on litter. The Florida Aquarium is also a project partner.\nWith an award of EPA’s Trash Free Waters grant in 2019, TBEP and partners deployed and maintained 12 trash capture devices within the Tampa Bay watershed. At each site, project partners regularly clean out captured trash and record the unique characteristics of the debris. The data will be used to help identify the sources and develop a litter management plan template for Tampa Bay and other Gulf of Mexico estuaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

Expand waterborne fecal contamination monitoring to additional areas where people and pets congregate. Continue to educate the public about proper disposal of pet waste.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nAction moved and renamed from Public Access Action Plan (PA-1: Reduce Human and Pet Waste in Traditional Recreation Areas). Action expanded to encompass all Tampa Bay Area waters designated Class III “fishable and swimmable.” Focus placed on pet waste and direct human waste pollution.\nConsiderable progress has been made in addressing proper disposal of pet waste. Basin Management Action Plans have or will be adopted for bay waters designated as impaired for fecal coliforms, with specific strategies focused on reducing fecal coliform pollution. More information is needed to quantify whether and to what extent fecal contamination associated with recreational areas lacking restroom facilities, or from homeless populations in urban centers, is a problem.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nTampa Bay supports a wide range of aquatic recreational activities, including boating, fishing, swimming, and paddle-boarding. The health of Tampa Bay’s waters is linked to our region’s economy, environment and quality of life. Fecal contamination of waterways can contribute bacteria, viruses and parasites that cause a variety of illnesses ranging from rashes, infections and diarrhea to more serious and life-threatening conditions.\n\n\n\nThe shoreline on the western side of the Gandy Bridge is a traditional recreational area without restroom facilities. SOURCE: Tampa Tribune\n\n\nMany bay waters and tributaries experience fecal contamination periodically from a variety of sources, including sewer overflows, wildlife, domestic livestock, pets and humans. Potential problem areas include recreational areas without restroom facilities, marinas and mooring fields where discharges of waste from liveaboard boaters may occur (see Action PH-5) or urban waterfronts with large homeless populations.\nFecal matter from feral or free-roaming cats, or urban livestock may be a local or seasonal contributor (e.g., horse manure generated during racing season at Tampa Bay Downs). However, little is known about the magnitude of these localized impacts; overall, bacterial levels in waste from these animals are lower than for dogs or humans. Farms and ranches in the upper parts of the watershed can be sources of fecal contamination in more rural areas of the watershed, as well as backyard chicken coops in urban areas (see Action SW-8).\nSewer overflows are addressed elsewhere in this Plan (see Actions WW-3 and WW-5), as is monitoring of formal swimming beaches by area health departments (see Action PH-2) and pollution from liveaboard boaters (see Action PH-5). This action focuses on pet waste and human waste stemming from unregulated or underserved waterways in the bay watershed.\nSeveral traditional recreational areas along the bay, including the Courtney Campbell Causeway, the Gandy Causeway in northern St. Petersburg and the Pinellas Bayway, are enjoyed by thousands of people and their pets year-round. However, most of these traditional-use beach playgrounds lack bathroom facilities, and bacterial water contamination may result from human or dog waste in specific, localized areas. Funding and ongoing management of these areas remains a challenge for local governments with limited resources.\nMost surface waters in Florida are categorized as Class III waters, meaning they should be “fishable and swimmable” and support the propagation and maintenance of healthy, well-balanced populations of fish and wildlife. Under the Clean Water Act, states are required every two years to identify impaired waters that do not meet their designated uses, including those that exceed fecal coliform standards. The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) develops a list of impaired waters in Florida and adopts Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL) for priority waterbody segments it identifies as impaired. A TMDL is the maximum amount of an identified pollutant that a waterbody can assimilate while maintaining its designated uses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMap of Tampa Bay area watershed basins with bacterial impairments. SOURCE: FDEP\n\n\n\n\nThe Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) and its partners assisted FDEP in creating comprehensive Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs) for major portions of the Hillsborough, Alafia and Manatee Rivers impaired by fecal contamination. BMAPs present locally-specific strategies to reduce pollutant loadings to levels below established TMDLs, including identifying and assessing the relative contributions of bacterial loadings from sources within a watershed, or watershed segment.\nBMAPs identify projects in the following categories: Agricultural BMPs; Restoration and Water Quality Improvement Projects; Regulations, Ordinances, and Guidelines; Education and Outreach Efforts; Basic Stormwater Management Program Implementation; Wastewater Infrastructure Management, Maintenance Repair, and Upgrade; Special Studies, Planning, Monitoring, and Assessment.\nThe Hillsborough River BMAP (Hillsborough River Basin Working Group 2009) was developed by FDEP in collaboration with TBEP; Hillsborough, Pasco and Polk Counties; the Cities of Plant City, Tampa, and Temple Terrace; the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County and Hillsborough County Health Department; the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, the Florida Department of Transportation, the Southwest Florida Water Management District and the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.\n\nHillsborough River Basin Working Group. 2009. “Hillsborough River Basin Management Action Plan for the Implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads - Adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in the Hillsborough River Basin for Fecal Coliform Bacteria.” Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Environmental Protection. https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/hillsb_bmap_adopted.pdf.\nAll surface waters in the Hillsborough River Basin are designated as Class III waters, with portions above the Hillsborough River Dam designated as Class 1 (potable water) and an Outstanding Florida Water. The Hillsborough River BMAP identified management strategies necessary to achieve the fecal coliform TMDLs for six stream segments: Blackwater Creek, New River, Sparkman Branch, Baker Creek, Flint Creek and the Lower Hillsborough River.\nThe BMAP process in other urban areas has identified homeless populations as a potential contributor to fecal contamination. This possibility was discussed during development of the Hillsborough River BMAP; research is needed to quantify and address this sensitive issue. Since BMAP implementation in 2009, fecal coliform levels (an indicator of fecal contamination) have generally improved in all the Hillsborough River sub-basins (Sherwood and Morrison 2013). TBEP has developed an open science workflow to download EPC FIB data, analyze the results, and create summary maps or plots.\n\nSherwood, E., and G. Morrison. 2013. “Hillsborough River Fecal Coliform BMAP Update (2013).” 05-13. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MZnK3cMzV7LRg6dTbCKX8AOZU0GNurJJ/view?usp=drivesdk.\nThe Alafia River BMAP (2014) is a collaborative ef­fort developed by FDEP with area-wide stakeholders, TBEP and the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium. This BMAP addresses four water body segments impaired for fecal coliform contamination: Turkey Creek, Mustang Ranch Creek, English Creek and Poley Creek.\nThe Manatee River BMAP (2014) is a collaborative effort devel­oped by FDEP with area-wide stakeholders, TBEP and the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium. This BMAP addresses four waterbody segments impaired for fecal coliform contamination: Rattlesnake Slough, Cedar Creek, Nonsense Creek and Braden River above Evers Reservoir.\n\n\n\nTampa Bay has numerous dog-friendly beaches.\n\n\nTBEP’s Pooches for the Planet pet waste education campaign, launched in 2006, has helped focus regional attention on a significant source of fecal coliform for which prevention is a cost-effective and simple solution.\nNumerous studies have shown that pet waste is a significant contributor to bacterial loadings in urban stormwater. The approximately 500,000 dogs in the bay watershed produce about 125 tons of waste daily. Surveys have shown that about 40% of dog owners do not pick up after their pets, meaning 45 tons is left unscooped. This dog waste is carried by stormwater to the closest waterway. Just one ounce of dog feces contains 23 million bacteria — nearly twice that of human waste.\nPooches for the Planet applied social marketing principles to encourage dog owners to pick up and properly dispose of their dog’s waste. Elements included:\n\nGPS mapping of dog poop piles prior to and following pet waste education. Three participating neighborhoods demonstrated an average 85.5% reduction in the number of dog poop piles left on the ground in waterfront parks in their communities.\nEye-catching signs posted at riverfront and bayfront parks in Tampa and Manatee County, and at all dog parks in Pinellas County. Signs and pet waste stations were posted at nine neighborhood or regional parks in St. Petersburg.\n“Scoop That Poop” informational posters, rack cards and business-sized “Scoop That Poop” pledge cards distributed to more than 500 veterinary clinics in the 3-county area.\nA 60-second video PSA about the importance of proper pet waste disposal.\nMore than 1,000 “Scoop That Poop” door hangers distributed as part of a pilot project in three neighborhoods in St. Petersburg. An additional 5,000 door hangers have been distributed by request to area neighborhoods, condos and apartment complexes.\n1,800 free Pooches for the Planet adoption kits distributed through county and humane society animal shelters in Manatee and Pinellas counties. The kits contained pet waste bag dispensers, a pet waste cartoon CD, and a listing of county dog parks, along with toys, treats and discount coupons for pet supplies and services. More than 90% of the respondents in a follow-up survey indicated they properly dispose of their dog’s waste.\n\n\n\n\nAn information station at Rivercrest Park in Tampa was part of TEBP’s Pooches for the Planet pet waste education campaign.\n\n\nSignificant pet waste educational programming also was sponsored by the Southwest Florida Water Management District, and implemented by the Keep America Beautiful affiliates in the area. Pet waste education is now a regular part of environmental education in the Tampa Bay region, and pet waste bag stations are installed and maintained at all area dog parks and dog beaches, as well as many other city and county parks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Reduce nitrogen runoff from urban landscapes\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nContinue to support and improve local fertilizer ordinances. Expand Best Management Practices (BMPs) certification programs for general landscape maintenance personnel. Explore incentives for homeowners to replace high-maintenance landscapes with lower maintenance alternatives. Expand outreach to homeowner and condo associations about statewide laws supporting water-conserving landscapes in deed-restricted communities and recommended changes to landscape covenants to comply with those laws. Continue research to quantify reduction in nitrogen loadings from reduced fertilizer use.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nThis action, formerly Action SW-12, has been merged with related Actions SW-1, SW-2, SW-3 and SW-11 to focus on the broader theme of reducing overall runoff from urban and residential landscapes.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nResidential fertilizer is a significant source of nitrogen to the bay, accounting for about 20% of the nitrogen carried in stormwater. The costs of treating stormwater from urban areas (estimated at $3,500 per pound of nitrogen removed, per the statewide Section 319h stormwater project database) led many bay area communities to adopt local fertilizer ordinances as a practical and cost-effective way to substantially reduce nitrogen inputs at little cost to taxpayers. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) was instrumental in the development and adoption of these city and county ordinances.\n\n\n\nLandscapes with reduced turfgrass conserve water and reduce runoff. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nMost of the ordinances prohibit use of nitrogen fertilizers from June 1-September 30, when the region receives 60% of its average annual rainfall and the potential for fertilizer runoff is greatest. They also require use of slow-release nitrogen fertilizers outside the summer rainy season to minimize nutrient leaching.\nOrdinances in Pinellas County (and all 24 municipalities within the County) and the City of Tampa ban both use and sales of nitrogen lawn and landscape fertilizers in the summer. The Hillsborough County and Manatee County ordinances restrict use of these products in the summer. The Pasco County ordinance mirrors a statewide model that prohibits fertilizer application when flood or storm watches are issued or likely, or when heavy rains are expected. Effectiveness of ordinances without sales restrictions could be enhanced by amendments to require stores where fertilizer is sold to post signs about the laws and to identify compliant products.\nTBEP led regional fertilizer education efforts at the request of its Policy Board. The resulting Be Floridian campaign utilized social marketing principles to promote compliance with summer fertilizer bans. The campaign capitalized on the importance of water-based recreation to bay residents, urging them to “skip the fertilizer in the summer” to protect the waters that make living here fun. It also encouraged homeowners to “Garden Like A Floridian” by replacing turfgrass with lower-maintenance plants.\n\n\n\nBillboards like this one along I-275 in St. Petersburg reminded residents to avoid use of fertilizer in the summer.\n\n\nOver a 5-year period, Be Floridian used billboards, print ads, digital ads, vehicle wraps, a resource-rich website, shareable infographics, an online pledge and targeted outreach at both community events and garden centers (including big box stores) that sell lawn care products. A dynamic social media presence was enhanced by the campaign’s plastic pink yard flamingo mascot. A traveling exhibit of yard flamingos painted by area artists toured museums, art centers, tourist attractions and an airport promoting the “Protect Our Fun” theme. More than 230,000 people viewed the unique artist-painted flock during its year-long tour of the region.\nEvaluations of Be Floridian showed that the campaign helped to boost knowledge of and compliance with the fertilizer ordinances. Fewer than 5% of respondents in a 2015 evaluation survey identified summer months as the best time to fertilize lawns, and 63% said they were less likely to use fertilizer in summer because of what they had learned (up from 47% in a 2012 survey). External social science surveys conducted as part of an overall evaluation of fertilizer practices and ordinance awareness also showed widespread awareness that fertilizer should not be applied before a heavy rain. That research also found that Pinellas County residents were more aware of fertilizer ordinances, and applied significantly less fertilizer to their lawns.\n\n\n\nPinellas County installed wraps on several fleet vehicles to promote pollution prevention.\n\n\nA variety of other educational programs continue to reinforce and expand outreach to homeowners, property managers and lawn care professionals. The longstanding Florida Yards & Neighborhoods Program (FY&N) administered by UF/IFAS Extension is delivered locally through county extension offices. The FY&N program promotes Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ to reduce water, fertilizer and pesticide use. Extension specialists also provide Best Management Practices training now required by state law for all commercial fertilizer applicators in Florida.\nAdditional training for general landscape maintenance personnel on key aspects of lawn care that influence water quality (such as management of grass clippings) is required in Pinellas and Manatee counties. That training is provided by county staff, but potentially could be expanded to additional counties and conducted by Extension specialists if funding were available.\nMore effort also should be directed to educating landscapers, irrigation contractors, homeowners, homeowner associations and property managers about reducing or eliminating fertilizer use where reclaimed water is used to irrigate lawns, since reclaimed water contains varying amounts of nutrients depending on source (see Action WW-1). Pinellas County developed a map-based fertilizer reduction tool for users to type in their address to learn the recommended fertilizer application rate based on the average nutrient concentration of the reuse irrigation water serving their property.\nHillsborough and Pinellas counties also offer Adopt A Pond programs that teach residents how to improve management of stormwater ponds at the neighborhood level – including creation of vegetated shoreline buffer zones and reduced fertilizer and chemical use on neighborhood lawns that drain to the ponds. A comprehensive social marketing-based program led by UF/IFAS is increasing awareness and action to improve stormwater pond management among residents of the sprawling Lakewood Ranch community in Manatee and Sarasota counties.\n\n\n\nA healthy neighborhood stormwater pond with a vegetated shoreline buffer and littoral zone. SOURCE: David Shafer\n\n\nDeed-restricted Homeowner Associations (HOAs) continue to be a major barrier to a shift in cultural norms toward less-lawn or no-lawn landscapes that require less water and fertilizer use. These barriers exist despite the passage of state laws allowing Florida-Friendly Landscaping™ in deed-restricted communities to conserve water. Court cases still have not clearly established a precedent that favors this law over HOA covenants, although some HOAs have updated their covenants and plant lists to allow more flexibility and integrate UF/IFAS recommendations for Florida-friendly plants.\nIncentives to conserve water and reduce high-maintenance turfgrass also are needed. One promising model is the new “Turf Swap” program in Alachua County. Starting in April 2017, the program will offer cash rebates to property owners that replace irrigated turf with Florida Friendly LandscapingTM.\n\n\n\nA variety of Florida native and adapted plants create a beautiful no mow yard that needs little to no irrigation or fertilizer. SOURCE: UF/IFAS Extension\n\n\nAs of 2017, Pinellas County has a UF/IFAS Extension specialist dedicated to working with HOAs, condo associations and property managers. Pasco County’s FY&N coordinator also has had success in working with HOAs, and all the FY&N county programs consistently provide high-quality training and free assistance to homeowners across their geographic and demographic spectrums. Future efforts to reduce nitrogen from urban landscapes in the Tampa Bay watershed must focus on reaching and recruiting these key audiences.\nAdditional research is needed to quantify the impact of fertilizer ordinances on water quality over time, and to improve ordinance compliance. A study coordinated by TBEP found that a minimum of 5-6 years of monitoring is needed to test for statistically significant differences in environmental data collected from Tampa Bay residential communities with different fertilizer ordinances (Listopad, Souto, and Bohlen 2015).\n\nListopad, C., L.

    "text": "Expand adoption and implementation of Best Management Practices for commercial and urban agriculture\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nExpand utilization of agricultural Best Management Practices (BMPs) to reduce nitrogen runoff to the bay. Target increased BMP participation from farms in priority areas where Total Maximum Daily Load regulations (TMDLs) or Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs) exist. Support regional cost-sharing programs for implementing BMPs. Expand education about best practices to community gardens and homeowners with vegetable gardens, backyard chickens, horses or livestock.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS) has completed and adopted BMP manuals for every major commodity produced in the Tampa Bay watershed. Efforts to increase enrollment in FDACS BMP program are ongoing with outreach targeted to BMAP areas. Enrollment in the Hillsborough and Manatee BMAP areas is at or near 100%. FDACS and the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) have active cost-share programs to incentivize implementation of BMPs for commercial agriculture operations, while UF/IFAS provides educational materials and outreach on BMPs.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nNon-point source pollutants from agriculture include nutrients from fertilizer and animal waste and pesticides. With improvements in irrigation and fertilization practices, public acquisition of former croplands and ongoing conversion of more intensive agricultural operations for commercial and residential development, nitrogen loading from agricultural sources has decreased in some areas in the Tampa Bay watershed. Some types of agriculture, such as cow/calf operations on pastures, may generate less nutrient runoff than residential development with highly maintained lawns. Urban agriculture (including community and backyard vegetable gardens and chicken coops) is increasing in popularity due to rising demand for homegrown and locally sourced foods.\n\nAgriculture is an important economic driver in the region — Hillsborough, Polk and Manatee counties are among the top 6 Florida counties in value of agricultural products sold. Based on 2017–2021 estimates from the Tampa Bay Estuary Program’s Nitrogen Management Consortium, agriculture accounts for about 20% (approximately 759 tons of the 3,959 tons per year average) of total nitrogen loading to the bay from nonpoint source runoff.\nBMPs can help farmers reduce impacts to soil and water resources while maintaining economically viable crop production levels. BMPs generally include a broad array of structural (e.g., constructed swales or basins) and non-structural (e.g., preservation or prevention) approaches to conserving water and reducing fertilizer and pesticide use. Many BMPs are also designed to protect nearby water resources.\nBMPs that have been verified and deemed effective at reducing pollutants by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) have been adopted by rule by FDACS for all major agricultural commodities produced in the Tampa Bay region. BMP manuals are reviewed at least every five years. FDACS recognizes that many smaller farms are ineligible for enrollment in the current FDACS BMP Program, and there are various livestock, such as goats, sheep, pigs, and emus, that are not covered by current manuals.\n\n\nFDACS Adopted BMP ManualsManualAdoptionRule ReferenceSilviculture20085I-6Sod20085M-9Cow/Calf20095M-11Specialty Fruit & Nut20115M-13Equine20125M-14Citrus20135M-16Nursery20145M-6Vegetable & Agronomic Crops20155M-8Aquaculture20155L-3Dairies20165M-17Poultry20165M-19\n\n\nCurrently, if there is no applicable BMP manual for their livestock, farmers with diversified farm operations alternatively may adopt an approved conservation plan tailored to their operation (Rule 5M-12 Conservation Plans for Specified Agricultural Operations). Notably, facilities with large numbers of livestock in a confined area, known as animal feeding operations (AFOs) and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), are not regulated by FDACS. Instead, FDEP regulates AFOs under its industrial wastewater rules and CAFOs under its NPDES program. Hobby farmers are not currently enrolled in the FDACS BMP Program; however, FDACS plans to develop and adopt manuals for these operations.\nAppropriate BMPs are encouraged through technical and financial assistance and a streamlined regulatory process. Farmers who implement FDACS-adopted BMPs benefit from a presumption of compliance with state water quality standards for pollutants that the BMPs address. Farming operations in BMAP areas are required to implement FDACS-adopted BMPs, otherwise they must conduct prescribed water quality monitoring that is approved by FDEP or Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) to demonstrate compliance with water quality standards. FDACS prioritizes outreach to commercial operators within BMAP areas. Producers who enroll in the FDACS BMP Program benefit from a presumption of compliance regardless of whether they are located within an adopted BMAP boundary. FDACS maintains a public mapviewer of BMP enrollment by commodity type.\nFDACS and SWFWMD incentivize adoption of BMPs through partnerships, such as the Facilitating Agricultural Resource Management Systems (FARMS) program that make it more feasible for farmers to implement new technologies. * The mini-FARMS program is a partnership of FDACS and SWFWMD that provides small farmers (less than 100 irrigated acres) reimbursement for 75% of the cost (up to $5000) to implement water conserving BMP projects. Farmers must be enrolled in the FDACS BMP Program to be eligible for mini-FARMS grants. SWFWMD offers the FARMS cost-share program for any farm located in the SWFWMD. * The Florida Farm Bureau County Alliance for Responsible Environmental Stewardship (CARES) program publicly recognizes farmers and ranchers that are enrolled with the FDACS BMP Program and remain in good standing with the FDACS Implementation Assurance Program. Producers receive a certificate and a “This Farm CARES” sign to place at their farm gate.\nIn 2014, FDACS’ Office of Agricultural Water Policy (OAWP) adopted a standardized statewide Implementation and Assurance Program consistent across all regions, commodities and BMP manuals. The program consists of two key components: mail-out surveys and site visits. Mail-out surveys are commodity specific and rotate between commodities year-to-year. The surveys contain a series of questions about management actions that correspond to the targeted BMPs for that commodity. Site visits utilize a standard form with inspections of BMP compliance for nutrient management, irrigation management and water resource protection.\nWith the passage of the Clean Waterways Act (2020), FDACS is expected to increase enrollment and inspections in BMAP areas statewide. As of 2022 within the three BMAP areas of TBEP (Alafia River, Hillsborough River, and Manatee River drainage areas), 15,089 out of 27,637 acres of agricultural lands were enrolled. Almost three-quarters of enrolled lands within BMAPs are cattle ranches. FDACS reports that 7,754 acres (644 parcels) of the remaining unenrolled lands are potentially enrollable. All except one of the required biennial site visits of agricultural operations within TBEP area BMAPs were completed between 2020-2022. Statewide, only two percent of inspection visits found the operations out of compliance with BMPs. The most common types of deficiencies involved record keeping, soil or tissue testing, or exceeding fertilizer application rates.\n\nUF/IFAS Extension Agents provide outreach to both commercial and non-commercial operators to encourage BMP adoption. Outreach to rural hobby operators (e.g., horse boarding facilities, alpaca ranches, rabbit breeding operations), especially with property adjacent to waterways, should be a focus. In addition, education should be extended to urban farmers with a greater potential to contribute pollution to stormwater runoff, including community gardens, backyard gardens and chicken coops.\nWith the growing popularity and interest among urban homeowners in backyard chicken coops, Pinellas County (and five of its municipalities), the City of Tampa, Polk County, and Manatee County have adopted backyard chicken ordinances. Some ordinances have setback requirements for the coop, which can help minimize stormwater pollution from waste. UF/IFAS is developing a Backyard Poultry 101 Workshop for Small Farms Agents in several counties, which will likely include recommendations for managing waste.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

Support additional research on regionally occurring algal bloom species that have the potential to affect Tampa Bay. Continue education on the causes and effects of HABs in Tampa Bay.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nNew Action. Prior Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) contributions include: 1) funding an assessment of the distribution of cysts of the harmful algal bloom species Pyrodinium bahamense in Old Tampa Bay sediments (Karlen and Campbell 2012), 2) supporting a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) project through the Tampa Bay Environmental Restoration Fund to monitor the extent and duration of HABs and map algal biomass in surface waters of Old Tampa Bay and 3) developing an integrated ecosystem model in Old Tampa Bay to understand management actions that could reduce Pyrodinium blooms.\n\nKarlen, D. J., and K. Campbell. 2012. “The Distribution of Pyrodinium Bahamense Cysts in Old Tampa Bay Sediments.” 07-12. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RgHLp306QHzOgPmbq8HjGygnGaH9g2yt/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nA HAB is the proliferation of a toxic algal species that negatively affects natural resources or humans. Blooms occur when algae reproduce or accumulate at abundances much greater than normal for specific geographic areas. Because HABs can discolor water, they are sometimes referred to as ‘red tides’ or ‘brown tides’ depending on the algal species. However, this terminology can be confusing because HABs do not always discolor the water and discolored water may also be caused by non-harmful algal species or other phenomena.\n\n\n\nBlooms of a harmful algae called Pyrodinium bahamense have occurred in Old Tampa Bay every summer since 2000. SOURCE: Dorian Photography\n\n\nOccurrence of algal blooms is influenced by environmental factors — such as water temperature, light and nutrient availability, rainfall and water circulation — as well as biotic interactions such as competition with other algae and grazing by zooplankton and shellfish. HABs can negatively affect ecosystems by shading seagrasses, disrupting food webs and killing wildlife. High biomass blooms can contribute to the formation of low oxygen “dead-zones,” and some HAB species produce potent toxins harmful to people and marine life.\n\n\n\nFormation of harmful algal blooms (HABs) is a complex interaction of physical, biological and human factors that affect the timing and severity. SOURCE: A Primer on Gulf of Mexico harmful algal blooms, FWRI, FIO, MML, GOMA, GCOOS 2013\n\n\nSpecies associated with HABs in Tampa Bay include:\n\nCyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae), a photosynthetic bacteria nearly ubiquitous in marine and freshwaters. Some but not all cyanobacteria can produce a bright blue-green tint or slimy scum. Similarly, some but not all cyanobacteria are known to produce one or more biotoxins. Extensive blue-green algal blooms occurred in Tampa Bay in the 1970s and 1980s, associated with nutrient pollution from poorly treated wastewater. Blue-green algal blooms now occur mostly in nutrient-rich freshwater systems such as Lake Thonotosassa, although there has been a recent uptick in observation of the marine cyanobacteria Dapis pleousa. Preemptive measures to help prevent blue-green algal blooms in Tampa Bay focus on maintaining nutrient loading at target levels (see Action WQ-1).\nKarenia brevis (also known as Florida’s ‘red tide’ alga) is a single-celled dinoflagellate naturally occurring in marine and estuarine waters of Florida. Blooms develop 10-40 miles offshore, and are sometimes brought inshore by currents and winds. Although there is no direct link between coastal nutrient pollution and the initiation, frequency or severity of an offshore red tide bloom, nutrient runoff can help sustain blooms that are transported inshore. Red tide produces neurotoxins (brevetoxins) that can kill fish, seabirds, turtles and marine mammals; cause respiratory distress in people; and accumulate to dangerous levels in shellfish. Presently, there is no practical and acceptable way to control the formation of red tide blooms or remove the resulting toxins from the water.\nPyrodinium bahamense is also a naturally occurring dinoflagellate. It produces saxitoxins, which can accumulate in shellfish and cause poisoning if the shellfish are consumed. No closures of shellfish harvesting areas have been necessary in Tampa Bay to date, largely because no shellfish harvesting is allowed in Old Tampa Bay where blooms most frequently occur. Pyrodinium forms resting cysts that settle from the water column to sediments, forming a cyst bed to seed future blooms. There were no recorded occurrences of Pyrodinium in the bay between 1983 and 2000. However, blooms have occurred every summer since 2000 (Lopez et al. 2021). In the future, the intensity, timing and duration of Pyrodinium blooms may be influenced by increasing summer water temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns and corresponding changes in salinity and nutrient inputs. Additional research is needed to understand the factors associated with blooms of Pyrodinium and potential effective management actions.\n\n\nLopez, C. B., S. Shankar, S. G. Kaminski, M. Garrett, and K. A. Hubbard. 2021. “Linking Pyrodinium Bahamense Physiology and Behavior to Population Growth and Loss in Nature and Implications for Management.” 07a-21.

Although Tampa Bay meets water quality management goals in most years in most bay segments (see Action WQ-1), HABs occur regularly in Old Tampa Bay, a bay segment that inconsistently meets water quality targets. In particular, blooms of the potentially toxic dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense are occurring more frequently and for longer duration, with blooms occurring regularly since 2000. However, these blooms have yet to produce harmful ecological impacts — such as fish and shellfish toxicity resulting in large fish kills or widespread, low dissolved oxygen events. Therefore, they have been characterized as nuisance algal blooms. The factors that drive Pyrodinium blooms in Old Tampa Bay are not fully understood, but the formation of resting cysts and establishment of Pyrodinium resting cyst beds is important for bloom recurrence each year.\n\n\n\nLife cycle of the dinoflagellate Pyrodinium bahamense. SOURCE: FWC\n\n\nThrough a NOAA RESTORE Actionable Science grant, the Florida Fish & Wildlife Research Institute (FWRI) partnered with the TBEP to co-develop research initiatives that support decision making for actions that control dinoflagellate growth and improve water quality conditions supportive of longer-term seagrass recovery in Old Tampa Bay (Lopez et al. 2023). Potential management actions address cell growth as well as cell loss, such as causeway or flood control structure modifications that improve circulation and increase physical transport of algal cells out of Old Tampa Bay (Luther and Meyers 2022) and potential shellfish restoration projects that increase grazing rates on algal cells (Lopez et al. 2022).\n\nLopez, C.

Widespread “superblooms” in the lagoon since 2011, fueled in part by large volumes of nutrient-laden runoff, have caused a 60% loss of seagrasses, and unusually high mortality in fish, pelicans and manatees. Residents and tourism-dependent businesses have suffered the loss of key recreational resources for extended periods.\nThe environmental, economic, and social impact of the significant red tide event in 2017-2019 was documented retroactively through analysis of crowd-sourced information from the social media platform Twitter. An open science social media dashboard that is responsive to episodic HAB and spill events is under development. FWC maintains a toll-free Fish Kill Reporting Hotline and online reporting form and, in response to public concern, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) launched a similar toll-free Bloom Reporting Hotline and online reporting form for residents to report algal blooms.\nIn April 2021, harmful algae blooms resulted from an emergency release of ~215 million gallons of contaminated water into Tampa Bay from the aging phosphogypsum stacks of the former phosphate processing plant at Piney Point. TBEP coordinated the efforts of numerous partners to document, analyze, and communicate the bay’s response by developing an open science data portal for the community and researchers to make sense of the more than 12,000 data points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

Develop nitrogen loading estimates for septic systems in the Tampa Bay area. Support adoption of new septic system nitrogen reduction technology and requirements for regular maintenance and inspection.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Local municipal partners have mapped septic systems and made progress extending central sewer and converting septic systems strategically and opportunistically with land development. The Basin Area Management Action Plan (BMAP) process has helped identify hotspots and develop strategies to reduce bacterial loading (see Action PH-4).\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nOverall, bay-wide nitrogen loadings from septic systems are minor when compared to other sources, such as stormwater and air pollution (see Action WQ-1). A 1995 study estimated the total nitrogen loading to the bay from septic systems at 220 tons/yr, about 5% of the total (Ayres Associates 1995). A 2016 study of septic systems located within 200 meters of a waterbody within the ungaged basins of Tampa Bay estimated 4,666 septic systems contribute 40 tons of TN per year with 32% of the load flowing to Hillsborough Bay and 28% flowing to Manatee River (Janicki Environmental 2016).\n\nAyres Associates. 1995. “An Estimate of Nutrient Loadings from Wastewater Residuals Management and Onsite Wastewater Treatment Systems in the Tampa Bay Watershed.” Brookesville, Florida: Southwest Florida Water Management District.\n\nJanicki Environmental. 2016. “Information Regarding the Effect of Removing on-Site Disposal Systems to Nutrient Loadings Rates.” Final Technical Memorandum TBNMC 2017 RA Update. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_tsGwwql-1z3cAsn8am-yRQ1pdfhXD6Q/view.\n\n\n\nExpansion of Hillsborough’s South County WWTP will allow treatment of 10 million gallons of wastewater daily — enough to accommodate growth in the area through 2025. SOURCE: Gresham Smith and Partners\n\n\nWhile nitrogen loading from septic systems is a concern, so are other chemicals including phosphates and “emerging contaminants” such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, and microplastics (see Action COC-4), and bacterial pollution (see Action PH-4). Failed septic systems in residential or rural areas can contribute large numbers of coliform and other bacteria to surface and groundwater, especially in areas with large concentrations of older septic systems more prone to malfunctioning. Poorly maintained package plants (small privately owned wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are also of concern. Over the last decade, several of these have been closed and wastewater flow consolidated with larger, more efficient municipal WWTPs.\nBased on permit data from the Florida Department of Health (FDOH), there may be as many as 250,000 septic systems in the four coastal counties of the bay area, almost half built before 1970. For many years, new developments within Urban Service Areas have been required to hook up to central sewer, and expansion of Urban Service Areas over time has facilitated conversion of additional properties to central sewer. Even so, thousands of new permits for septic systems have been issued in the last decade. FDOH’s 2016 state-wide Florida Water Management Inventory (Ursin 2016) documents and maps the wastewater treatment method and the drinking water source for the more than 6 million improved parcels in the state. The study documented that in the three counties surrounding the bay, about 117,000 parcels have or likely have septic systems. This estimate does not include the portion of Pasco County within the bay watershed. More than half of all parcels in Pasco are on septic. Pinellas County has the fewest parcels served by septic systems (15,000 or 3.6%).\n\nUrsin, E. 2016. “Florida Onsite Sewage Treatment and Disposal Systems Inventory: Final Project Report.” DEP Contract No. G0431. Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Health. https://www.floridahealth.gov/environmental-health/onsite-sewage/research/_documents/rrac/10212016-draftfinalreportflwmi.pdf.\n\n\n\nLocations of known and estimated septic systems in the Tampa Bay Watershed. SOURCE: FDOH\n\n\nLocal government partners have basic inventories and maps of septic systems, and all have made good to substantial progress in converting septic systems to central sewer. Pinellas and Hillsborough counties and the cities of Clearwater, Largo, St. Petersburg, Tampa and Lakeland all have ongoing projects to convert more septic systems to central sewer as opportunities arise. Projects are tracked in the Action Plan Database of the Tampa Bay Nitrogen Management Consortium (see Action WQ-1). Challenges remain with regard to central sewer expansion funding, cross-jurisdictional coordination, and delays in homeowner and businesses conversions due to costs and other factors.\nConversion from septic to sewer service can be costly, with residential hookup fees ranging anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000 or more. This underscores the need for financing options such as interest-free loans and cost-sharing grants to assist residents who may have limited ability to pay. Additionally, availability of central sewer service may encourage higher density development in environmentally sensitive areas, an issue local governments must consider in their long-term planning. Without adequate user fees, local governments must bear the costs of additional operating capacity for their wastewater treatment plants.\nMeasures to address septic system sources of pollution have been developed through Basin Management Action Plans (BMAPs). BMAPs identify various sources of potential pollution related to a specific Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL), their relative contributions, additional research or monitoring needs and strategies to achieve TMDL reductions. Projects include high-probability septic system failure mapping (based on a number of criteria, including density, plat age, proximity to a water body, soil type and texture, seasonal high-water table, repair records and proximity to central sewer), microbial and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) source identification, septic system complaint response and septic system setbacks.\nWhile Florida law requires a 75-foot septic system setback from wells and surface waters, Manatee County implemented countywide requirements that mandate a 400-foot setback from waterways for new septic systems, encompassing freshwater, marine and tidal waters. If this setback is not feasible, then performance-based standards providing Advanced Wastewater Treatment (including additional nutrient removal capacity) must be achieved by the septic system. Hillsborough County also requires stricter setbacks as part of its wellfield protection buffers.\n\n\n\nA “passive nitrogen reduction” septic system utilizing bio-filters was installed and field-tested in 2015 at a residential site in Hillsborough County. SOURCE: Florida Department of Health\n\n\nIn 2015, FDOH completed the Florida Onsite Sewage Nitrogen Reduction Strategies Study, providing new methods and options for reducing nitrogen from septic systems in sensitive watersheds where sewers are not feasible. The seven-year project developed and field-tested new septic system designs, including system cost estimates and costs compared with existing systems. Systems were installed and tested at residential homes across the state, including a site in Hillsborough County.\nThe project also developed a nitrogen fate and transport model to estimate nitrogen contribution from septic systems in shallow aquifers. The Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) does not specifically quantify nitrogen loadings from septic tanks in overall watershed estimates; they are potentially captured as a part of non-point source and groundwater estimates. This is a future priority of the Nitrogen Management Consortium.\nAs of July 1, 2023, State legislation mandated that enhanced nutrient-reducing septic systems are required within watersheds with established nutrient TMDLs and BMAPs, and where central sewer service is unavailable. Regular inspections for septic systems near wells and surface waters remain an important issue to be addressed, potentially as initiatives arise as a result of the 2020 Clean Waterways Act, which transferred responsibility for implementing the Florida Statutes and regulations applicable to OSTDS to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection.\nLocally, city and county permits issued through the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) offer a mechanism for addressing chronic failures of septic systems and package plants. Local Land Development Codes may also address problem areas with repeated failures of septic systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Reduce the occurrence of sanitary sewer overflows to the bay\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nEncourage proper operation, maintenance and replacement of deteriorating and failing sanitary sewer infrastructure owned by utilities and private property owners. Encourage and support efforts to reduce groundwater and stormwater inflow and infiltration to sanitary sewer systems. Support local government capacity to gain adequate funding for needed capital improvement projects. Encourage communication, coordination and cooperation among regional utilities. Support public education and outreach about best practices for proper use and maintenance of privately-owned lateral sanitary sewer infrastructure (i.e., pipes connecting homes and businesses to municipal lines).\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Previously Action PH-1, this action is updated to incorporate new information about operation, maintenance and replacement of sanitary sewer infrastructure in the Tampa Bay watershed. It includes new information about efforts to improve communication, coordination and cooperation among regional utilities and a public education component.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nSanitary sewer systems are closed, underground conveyances designed to collect and transport domestic, commercial and industrial wastewater to centralized wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Occasionally, sanitary sewers can overflow and release untreated sewage into the environment — potentially contaminating surface waters and sediments and threatening public health. Reducing the occurrence of sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) is important to maintaining and improving water quality in Tampa Bay.\n\n\n\nSanitary sewer overflows may result in beaches being closed to swimming and fishing because of the potential for bacterial contamination. SOURCE: City of St. Petersburg\n\n\nSanitary sewers can overflow for a number of reasons, including improper design and capacity, aging infrastructure, line blockages and breaks, infiltration and inflow of stormwater, and equipment and power failures. Compound flooding from extreme rainfall events and sea level rise is projected to result in more frequent SSOs in the Tampa Bay watershed (Meyers et al. 2021). Addressing these challenges through proper operation and maintenance, capital improvement projects, education and enforcement will help reduce the incidence of sanitary sewer overflows.\nWhile initial design and construction problems can underlie some SSOs, it is more common for ongoing urban development to exceed original system capacity and lead to overflows. Solutions include retrofitting existing systems with additional pipes, bigger interceptors, reduced wet weather infiltration and inflow, more underground storage or additional WWTP treatment capacity.\nWastewater systems in the Tampa Bay area are showing their age. This is particularly true in older urban areas like the cities of St. Petersburg and Tampa. The City of Tampa launched the Progressive Infrastructure Planning to Ensure Stability (PIPES) program in 2017 with a goal to replace 20 miles of water lines and 30 miles of sewage pipes each year. Tampa also completed more than $15 million in maintenance projects at the Howard F. Curren Advanced WWTP. Another $36 M in facility improvements are either under construction, in design or planned. Elsewhere, Hillsborough County is retiring two aging WWTPs and consolidating treatment at the Northwest Regional Water Reclamation Facility to improve treatment efficiency and reduce power use.\n\n\n\nA sewer pipe clogged with fats, oils and greases.\n\n\nPipes can deteriorate and fail over time, especially those made from older, degradable materials like clay or Orangeburg — made of layers of wood pulp and pitch. For example, the volume of wastewater conveyed per person per day in Pinellas County is significantly higher in the South County system, where many pipes are made of vitrified clay, compared to the North County system, where the majority of pipes are made of PVC. This is likely due to the amount of infiltration and inflow entering via defects in the sanitary sewers. Between 2012 and 2015, Pinellas County completed 26 wastewater projects to reduce pollutant loading or SSOs at a cost of $7.6 M. Another seven projects totaling $16.4M are ongoing.\nThe City of Tampa has replaced pipes constructed of ductile iron that have failed due to corrosion, with new PVC pipes. Other infrastructure, including pumps, check valves and other moveable parts can also wear out, leading to mechanical failure. Older electric equipment or even lighting strikes can cause electrical failures at lift stations.\nBlockages can occur due to tree roots entering sanitary sewer systems through defects, breaks or cracks. They can also be caused by improper disposal of items into sanitary drains, including fats, oils and grease (FOG), baby wipes, new ‘flushable wipes’ and sanitary products. According to the City of Tampa, the number one cause of sewer overflows in the city is grease blockages. Tampa adopted a Grease Management Ordinance in 2006 to regulate the disposal of grease by grease haulers and food facilities. The city also provides outreach and education to the public about ways residents can keep improper items out of the sewer system.\n\n\n\nThis education campaign in Largo informs homeowners not to flush wipes, cotton pads, feminine products and other personal care products down toilets to reduce sewer overflows.\n\n\nBreaks and blockages can also contribute to added hydraulic stress on other parts of the system and produce a series of cascading failures down the line. Solutions to aging infrastructure and blockages include routine maintenance, cleaning and rehabilitation or replacement. A variety of leak detection technologies are available, including filling sections of pipe with smoke to help visualize breaks or using video cameras. There are newer, cheaper technologies (e.g., sonar) that can assist a utility in determining where to expend cleaning resources. Other “trenchless” technologies make repairs and rehabilitation easier, less expensive and cause less disturbance to the above-ground area.\nMany utilities in the Tampa Bay area have aggressive programs to replace older, deteriorating infrastructure. For example, Tampa invested $44 M to upgrade two master lift stations to improve wet-weather operations. Hillsborough Basin Management Action Plan (Hillsborough River Basin Working Group 2009; Florida Department of Environmental Protection 2016) participants committed to implement over 75 bacteria reduction projects, 45 of which were categorized as “wastewater infrastructure management” projects. Hillsborough County lined 214,000 feet of pipe with slip lining at a cost of $10 M, and the City of Largo invested $100 M for a new wet-weather force main. Pipes connecting homes and businesses to the municipal sewer system (private laterals) require similar attention, but are often neglected by property owners.\n\nHillsborough River Basin Working Group. 2009. “Hillsborough River Basin Management Action Plan for the Implementation of Total Maximum Daily Loads - Adopted by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in the Hillsborough River Basin for Fecal Coliform Bacteria.” Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Environmental Protection. https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/hillsb_bmap_adopted.pdf.\n\nFlorida Department of Environmental Protection. 2016. “2015 Progress Report for the Hillsborough River Basin Management Action Plan.” Tallahassee, Florida: Florida Department of Environmental Protection. https://floridadep.gov/sites/default/files/HillsboroughRiverBMAP-ProgRept2015.pdf.\n\nMarketing for Change. 2022. “Pipe Up: A Social Marketing Campaign to Reduce Nutrient and Bacteriological Pollution in Tampa Bay.” 05-22. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ClsjavjeUZgKuT56XScVYdnwXKX3_uOE/view?usp=sharing.\nTBEP launched the Pipe Up behavior change campaign in 2021 to encourage homeowners and homebuyers to inspect, repair, or replace aging private lateral sewer lines to prevent sanitary overflows into Tampa Bay and its watershed (Marketing for Change 2022). The campaign featured animated video and advertisements on Realtor.com, Facebook, and Instagram targeting home inspectors and homebuyers in the market for homes built before 1975. The next phase will continue in 2024.\nSanitary sewers in the Tampa Bay Area were not designed to transport groundwater and stormwater. Backups and overflows can occur when excessive amounts of groundwater and/or stormwater enter and overwhelm system capacity. This can result in sewage backups into homes, spills from manhole covers or lift stations or emergency discharges at WWTPs. Infiltration occurs when groundwater enters sanitary sewer systems through defective, permeable or broken pipes. Inflow occurs when stormwater enters the sanitary system through unauthorized connections (e.g., yard and roof drains, and submersible pumps). Sanitary sewer overflows due to inflow and infiltration are most commonly associated with rainstorms.\n\n\n\nHeavy rains can add large volumes of stormwater to sewer systems, causing them to overflow.\n\n\nFor example, unusually heavy rains in summer 2015 overwhelmed the City of St. Petersburg’s sanitary sewer system, and forced the city to discharge 31 million gallons of treated and untreated wastewater into Clam Bayou and Tampa Bay. The storm-related incident was compounded, in part, by loss of system capacity when the Albert Whitted WWTP was closed months earlier. Making matters worse, some homeowners associations, businesses and individual residents piped water out of flooded areas into the City’s sanitary sewers.\nIn retrospect, some overflows and releases due to the storm may have been avoidable if comprehensive system-wide action plans had been in place specifying emergency responses (similar to oil spill response plans), and if additional conveyance and storage capacity in neighboring utilities’ systems were made available. In Fall 2015, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) began convening regular meetings of regional utilities to improve communication, coordination and cooperation among them. One goal is to explore opportunities for cooperative resource and capacity-sharing among utilities during heavy storms or other emergencies.\nSolutions to reducing inflow and infiltration include regular inspection, rehabilitation and maintenance of broken, failing infrastructure. For example, leaky manhole covers can be made less susceptible to stormwater leaks by sealing them with manhole inserts. Rigorous construction inspections can assist in identifying and preventing illicit connections to sanitary sewer systems.\nThe City of St. Petersburg will invest more than $300 million in improvements to its wastewater treatment system through the year 2021 – including additional deep injection wells to dispose of treated wastewater during heavy rain events, expansion of the city’s three remaining WWTPs, and lining or sealing of targeted pipes and manholes.\nEquipment failures and lack of backup power can also cause overflows. Regular inspections and maintenance are important preventative measures. For example, Tampa installed emergency generators at some of its pump stations.\nClimate change will further strain aging wastewater infrastructure. Anticipated changes in storm intensity may escalate inflow and infiltration leading to more frequent sewer overflows and emergency releases. Rising sea levels and associated changes to groundwater may increase infiltration, corrode infrastructure and alter the effectiveness of wastewater treatment. As a result, climate change risks should be considered when planning new wastewater infrastructure. For example, planners may consider locating new wastewater treatment plants away from future surge and flood-prone areas and consider increasing capacity to accommodate anticipated increases in inflow and infiltration during more intense storms. Community resilience planning is underway in several municipalities in the bay watershed.\nThe University of South Florida developed a model to forecast the likelihood of future sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) and help utility operators plan for future climate scenarios with intense storm events (Meyers et al. 2021). Researchers created an interactive dashboard to demonstrate SSO probabilities under both past and potential future conditions. Simulations suggest Tampa Bay can expect weather related SSOs an average of 5-7 days per year with a 0.5 m rise in sea level.\n\nMeyers, S. D., S. Landry, M. W. Beck, and M. E.

    "text": "Establish and implement mitigation criteria\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nSupport progress toward habitat restoration goals by implementing mitigation criteria specific to Tampa Bay watersheds, for unavoidable wetland impacts. Identify priority sites for mitigation banks and off-site mitigation that help to achieve adopted targets for critical coastal habitats, including seagrasses, saltwater wetlands, freshwater wetlands and hard bottom habitats. Collaborate with the private sector to evaluate and improve mitigation. Establish long-term monitoring of mitigation sites across multiple habitats.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Action expanded to include recommendations for on- and off-site mitigation developed through the Mitigation Criteria Working Group. The Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) and the 2014 Freshwater Wetland Master Plan include tools for directing future mitigation where most ecologically beneficial. Evaluations of mitigation success can provide a framework to improve permitting and monitoring programs across multiple habitats.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMitigation involves restoring, enhancing, preserving or creating habitats to offset development-related impacts to wetlands, streams, seagrasses and other aquatic resources. Unlike restoration or preservation done primarily to enhance or maintain habitat quantity and quality, mitigation is required for permitted impacts that damage or destroy wetlands and other aquatic habitats. Federal, state, regional and local agencies regulate mitigation activities.\n\n\n\nAn evaluation of freshwater wetland mitigation projects in Hillsborough County indicated that larger wetlands provided more ecosystem services and performed better than smaller wetlands surrounded by urban development. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara.\n\n\nCurrently, mitigation can be achieved using three mechanisms:\n\nMitigation banks (Large mitigation areas that offer “credits” for impacts. Banks must demonstrate successful restoration prior to releasing or selling credits).\nIn-lieu fee programs (Monetary contributions to another entity to implement an identified large mitigation project).\nPermittee-responsible mitigation (The permit applicant conducts the mitigation Activity).\n\nPreservation, restoration and acquisition of existing wetlands is preferred. However, if wetland impacts are unavoidable, specific guidelines govern how, where and what type of mitigation must be conducted, and monitoring of project success. Mitigation may involve creation, enhancement, restoration or preservation of habitats. It can occur on the same site as the development activities, if space allows; off-site at an appropriate location; or at a mitigation bank. Long-term success of mitigation projects is variable and highly dependent upon the location, size, type of habitat created and maintenance provided.\nRegulatory agencies generally prefer mitigation banking or use of in-lieu fees because the larger scale and scope of these tools maximizes habitat benefits — especially when mitigation for smaller wetland mitigation projects (less than a few acres) can be bundled into larger parcels. There are multiple existing and planned mitigation banks in the bay watershed for both private and public development and infrastructure activities. The majority offer freshwater mitigation credits. Several mitigation banks are currently under review by regulatory agencies, but are not yet approved to release credits. Service areas for permitted mitigation banks generally encompass an entire watershed; applicants may choose to use credits from a bank in the same watershed to fulfill mitigation requirements.\n\n\n\nSuccessful restoration and mitigation projects can provide habitat for snook and other recreationally or commercially important fish species. SOURCE: Greg Urbano\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC), in association with the University of South Florida and other regional partners, evaluated the success of freshwater wetland mitigation projects permitted in Hillsborough County since 1987. The review compares the original mitigation designs to current status, using standardized wetland assessment methods. Preliminary findings show a 38% loss in total wetland area for the 63 constructed wetlands assessed; the majority of sites evaluated are one acre or less.\nForested wetlands mature more slowly but better mimic functions of comparable natural wetlands than non-forested (grassy) wetland mitigation projects. One solution may be to include both forested and non-forested components in freshwater mitigation efforts. Fire is critical to the success of grassy wetlands but is rarely employed in management of these areas.\n\n\n\nMitigation for forested freshwater wetlands, including mixed hardwood swamps, is generally less successful than for non-forested, grassy wetlands. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nThe Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) reviewed regulatory issues and options for compensatory mitigation that could potentially contribute significantly to the attainment of watershed-level habitat protection and restoration goals beyond publicly funded efforts (Robison et al. 2020). Both the EPCHC study and the Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) reinforce the need for more rigorous mitigation criteria to prevent deterioration of wetland quality and quantity in the bay watershed.\n\nRobison, D., T. Ries, J. Saarinen, D. Tomasko, and and C. Sciarrino. 2020. “Tampa Bay Estuary Program: 2020 Habitat Master Plan Update.” 07-20. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hp0l_qtbxp1JxKJoGatdyuANSzQrpL0I/view?usp=drivesdk.\nAmong the issues in need of clarification and consensus:\n\nConcerns that mitigation banks or in-lieu fee programs will be preferentially established where land is cheaper, even though these areas may be far removed from the actual wetland impacts. This is of particular concern in urban areas, where land costs are higher. Currently, mitigation outside the impacted watershed is rarely approved, but not prohibited. However, mitigation within the same sub-basin is not required, potentially creating wetland deficits in some areas.\nLoss of small isolated wetlands (less than ½-acre) for which mitigation is not required. These “frog ponds” are especially important for amphibians and the wading birds that feed on them.\nWhether private entities should be allowed to conduct mitigation activities on public lands.\nWhether public agencies should purchase large tracts of land specifically for future mitigation purposes, and whether acquisition of land alone can be used to satisfy mitigation requirements.\nWhether monitoring is stringent enough, and of adequate duration, to adequately assess long-term success. Additionally, there is no standardization of monitoring reports, so what is approved as successful by permitting agencies varies widely. Improvements in water quality and utilization of mitigation areas by fish and wildlife are rarely considered.\nWhether the current system, which utilizes credits based on type and quality of impacted and restored habitats, adequately compensates for wetland losses. For example, the current “No Net Loss” policy presents challenges to permitting agencies in moving beyond type-for-type mitigation.\nPotential secondary impacts to natural wetlands adjacent to development, such as changes in water quantity and quality. For example, increased runoff may alter hydrology, drowning native vegetation and creating artificial “ponded” wetlands dominated by nuisance plants like cattails and primrose willow that do not provide the same ecological benefits. Research is needed to examine and quantify these impacts and to improve transitional zones from manmade to natural wetlands.\n\nAlthough existing mitigation criteria focuses on freshwater wetlands, improvements are also needed in mitigating impacts to estuarine habitats such as seagrasses, marshes, mangroves and hard bottom habitats. Options that restore entire communities rather than a single habitat should be investigated, especially with regard to systems as varied as hard bottom communities.\n\n\n\nMangroves quickly recruit into newly restored tidal wetlands in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara.\n\n\nOpportunities for seagrass mitigation are generally limited to transplanting, often at high cost and with varying success (see Action BH-3). Since the vast majority of the bay’s seagrass gains are a result of increased water clarity from reduced nitrogen loadings, port authorities and other entities have requested use of pollution-reduction projects (such as stormwater or wastewater treatment) as mitigation for seagrass impacts in lieu of transplanting. This alternative is generally not permitted; however, recent projects to remove manmade causeways blocking tidal circulation at Fort De Soto Park and along the eastern portion of the Courtney Campbell Causeway serve as successful models. The Fort De Soto project, sponsored by SWFWMD, FDOT, and Pinellas County, directly impacted about one-quarter acre of seagrasses but resulted in improved water quality and almost 200 acres of seagrass expansion in the interior waters of the park. Seagrass mitigation credits were allowed for this work. Whether water quality in the proposed mitigation site is sufficient to foster seagrass growth is a key factor in such projects. An analysis of 20 seagrass mitigation projects around Florida is now being conducted by FWC and funded by FDEP; this study will help identify successful techniques for future consideration.\nMitigation criteria for other sensitive habitats, including hard bottom and live bottom, have not been established. TBEP developed protection and restoration targets for hard bottom in 2020; appropriate mitigation strategies could be explored to achieve those targets. Monitoring of mitigation associated with ship channel expansion and natural gas pipeline construction projects suggests that recreating structural hard bottom, such as limestone or rock reefs or outcroppings, is much simpler and more successful than transplanting the soft corals and sponges that grow on the hard substrates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

    "text": "Identify hard bottom communities and avoid impacts\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nIdentify and protect hard bottom and oyster reef habitats in Tampa Bay. Map and monitor existing oyster reef habitat; develop bay-wide goals for oyster reef habitat creation and protection; monitor animal use of reef habitat; support community-based oyster reef habitat restoration; and support mooring fields and buoys to protect hard bottom habitat.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Action revised from “Restrict impacts to hard bottom communities and evaluate the ecological effects of artificial hard bottom habitat.” New action highlights mapping and restoration efforts since 2006, permitting challenges and need for monitoring of ecological effects of artificial hard bottom and oyster habitats.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nHard bottom habitats in Tampa Bay include fossilized corals, rubble, limestone, other natural “reef-like” material and artificial reefs. They provide important substrate for the attachment of benthic species, including sponges, corals and oysters, and attract and support a diverse assemblage of marine invertebrates and fish, including many recreationally important species.\n\n\n\nAn Atlantic spadefish in a hard bottom area of Lower Tampa Bay is lured into camera range with a bait cage suspended from a PVC deployment unit. SOURCE: FWC\n\n\nOyster reefs are formed by the cumulative buildup of shell material from successive generations of oysters. They occur predominantly in shallow nearshore areas, especially in brackish waters near creek and river mouths. Oyster reefs provide a number of ecological, economic and recreational benefits, including food and habitat for a large number of species. They also can reduce erosion, stabilize shorelines and improve water quality.\nHard bottom and oyster reefs in Tampa Bay are protected submerged habitats under state and federal wetland regulations. They are considered Essential Fish Habitat and afforded additional federal protections under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Both habitats are relatively rare and sparsely distributed in the bay.\nIn 2016 the Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) mapped an estimated 166 acres of oyster reef in Tampa Bay. SWFWMD includes remote oyster reef mapping as part of their biannual aerial seagrass surveys in Tampa Bay. Previous mapping efforts have highlighted the difficulty in assessing overall oyster habitat extent in the bay, especially along mangrove and hardened shorelines (O’Keefe, Arnold, and Reed 2006).\n\nO’Keefe, K., W. Arnold, and D. Reed. 2006. “Tampa Bay Oyster Mapping and Assessment.” 03-06.

The first project, funded by the Tampa Bay Environmental Restoration Fund (TBERF), focused on the southeast region of Tampa Bay from the mouth of the Little Manatee River to the mouth of Terra Ceia bay. The second project, funded by SWFWMD, focused on Old Tampa Bay, areas adjacent to MacDill Air Force Base, Terra Ceia Bay and the mouth of the Manatee River. Additionally, TBEP was awarded a grant from Pinellas County’s settlement funds from the Deepwater Horizon accident to map hard bottom habitat in bay waters offshore southeastern Pinellas County, using similar techniques as were employed by SWFWMD. Results of this work (completed in 2019) added to the mapped extent of these habitats within the bay (CSA Ocean Sciences, Inc. 2019). These mapping projects included field surveys utilizing a combination of side scan sonar, underwater video and ground truthing. Ground truthing will categorize biological communities associated with various hard bottom habitats, bathymetric relief, natural or artificial hard bottom and contiguous reef or hard rubble.\n\nCSA Ocean Sciences, Inc. 2019. “Tampa Bay Hard Bottom Mapping Project.” 08-19. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cVe4VUAIXKeaoQiT-hQt-GxZajwKjksk/view?usp=drivesdk.\n\n\n\nResearchers used sonar mapping to survey hard-bottom habitats in the bay: SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\nThe Oyster Habitat Suitability Index (or HSI) was developed to guide restoration efforts by identifying priority areas in Tampa Bay that can support long-term restoration. Environmental factors including sediment, salinity, depth, seagrass, and channel locations help to identify appropriate locations for oyster reef placement. The HSI combines these multiple data layers to create a scored map that indicates locations where restoration may be successful.\nProtecting and restoring hard bottom and oyster reef habitats will contribute to improved water quality, increased habitat and shoreline stabilization in Tampa Bay. While restoration of all lost hard bottom and oyster reef habitats in Tampa Bay is unrealistic, an alternative is to maintain the existing mapped extent of these habitats (see Actions BH-1 and BH-8). A 2021 study of how the location, elevation, and substrate type of a constructed oyster reef influenced oyster population characteristics found a higher elevation reefs had higher live oyster density, lower gastropod predator density and less sediment burial (Adams et al. 2021). However, the oysters that did survive on low elevation reefs were larger in size, reflecting longer feeding durations and enhanced growth potential.\n\nAdams, C. Scott, Kara R. Radabaugh, Savanna Hearne, Emily Ritz, Gary E. Raulerson, Serra Herndon, and and Ryan P. Moyer. 2021. “Oyster Density on Varying Artificial Substrates and Reef Elevations in Tampa Bay, Florida (USA).” 16-21. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fBuHdbrydQwSZaHWz0Up3YTCrR1Gadzu/view?usp=sharing.\nSeveral initiatives are working to create or restore hard bottom and oyster reef habitats in the bay, including building reefs with oyster shells collected from restaurants in Manatee County (Gulf Coast Oyster Recycling and Renewal) and installing vertical oyster gardens from docks. Tampa Bay Watch is working with community volunteers to create and enhance oyster reefs by deploying clean, fossilized oyster shells as a base upon which live oysters can settle and form natural reefs. Since 2001, more than 4,700 volunteers have created almost 14,000 linear feet of oyster reef in the bay — using more than 1,400 tons of oyster shell. Other projects have installed reef balls to support shoreline stabilization and oyster reef formation along the MacDill Air Force Base peninsula, the Alafia Banks and the Kitchen.\nAudubon Florida created more than 2,000 linear feet of new oyster reef to improve water quality, facilitate growth of native salt marsh and mangroves and slow erosion of the Richard T. Paul Alafia Bank Bird Sanctuary. The Sanctuary is one of the largest and most diverse waterbird colonies in the continental United States, but is threatened by erosion from boat wakes and storm waves (see Action FW-6).\nThe Artificial Reef Program of the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) manages eight artificial reefs in Tampa Bay that are popular angling spots. By providing hard bottom substrates and associated biological communities, artificial reefs increase biological diversity and productivity. A 2005 study found that 385 species used EPCHC’s reefs, including popular sport fish like grouper, tarpon and snook, as well as a variety of crabs, shrimp, mollusks and worms. EPCHC will begin a 10-year update of their original study in 2016, enlisting observations from commercial and recreational fishermen. Research on artificial reef design and associated community structure may yield valuable management information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFishermen and divers who use Hillsborough County’s eight artificial reef sites spend more than $30 million in the county annually, according to a 2009 study by Florida Sea Grant.\n\n\nThreats to hard bottom and oyster reef habitats and their biological communities include changes in sediment accretion and removal from dredge and fill operations, channel modifications and harbor expansions, sea level rise and ocean acidification, boat groundings, cumulative damage from anchors, overfishing, harmful algal blooms, invasive species, parasites and pathogens.\n\n\n\nA fisheries scientist with FWC deploys a PVC unit housing an underwater video camera to document fisheries in the bay’s hard-bottom habitats. The unit is baited to entice fish within camera range. SOURCE: Gary Raulerson\n\n\nThe invasive Asian Green Mussel (Perna viridis) is a noteworthy threat that should be monitored on both natural and artificial reefs in Tampa Bay. Green mussels were first observed in Tampa Bay in 1999 and are known to foul boat hulls, clog power plant cooling water intake structures and displace native oyster and mussel populations. After initial rapid population growth in the bay, anecdotal evidence suggests that populations have stabilized — although the mechanism of their control is unknown.\nConstruction of the Gulfstream natural gas pipeline in Tampa Bay impacted nearly 20 acres of hard bottom habitat. Impacts were mitigated by installing shallow-water limestone reefs and transplanting soft corals and sponges. The low-relief limestone reefs were quickly colonized by plants and animals; however, the transplants of soft corals and sponges were largely unsuccessful. A hydraulic fracture, or “frac out,” that inadvertently released drilling fluids to the surface during the horizontal drilling also impacted hard bottom.\nAdditional hard bottom impacts are likely in Tampa Bay as a result of dredging associated with future harbor improvements. “Frac outs” may occur during installation of underwater communications cables or other pipelines in the future.\n\n\n\nSheepshead and spottail pinfish are captured by an underwater camera on a hard-bottom reef in Tampa Bay. SOURCE: Walt Jaap\n\n\nImpacts to hard bottom and oyster reef habitats are not easily mitigated, and greater recognition and protection of these rare habitats is needed. Therefore, the effectiveness of current permitting and mitigation rules in preserving hard bottom and oyster reef habitats throughout the bay warrants evaluation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

SOURCE: Lindsay Cross\n\n\nThe Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) continues to map seagrass acreage every two years using aerial photography, while local government partners have helped ground-truth seagrass quality at selected transects throughout the bay since 1988 and 1998, respectively. Seagrass communities are vulnerable to environmental variability (such as heavy rainfall events) and human impacts (such as boat propellers and groundings). After reaching a historic peak of 41,655 acres in 2016, the bay had only 30,137acres of seagrasses in 2022, a significant decrease of 11,518 acres even though water quality standards were met in all bay segments except Old Tampa Bay. Continued biennial mapping of baywide seagrass coverage is necessary to identify and prioritize affected areas.\nMapping and monitoring of tidal flats and oyster communities began in 2012 as part of seagrass aerial surveys conducted by SWFWMD. Beginning in 2015, new standards for interpreting oyster reefs and tidal flats from aerial photography were instituted for greater accuracy. New survey techniques, such as sidescan sonar and underwater video, are being used to map hard bottom habitats (see Action BH-4).\n\n\n\nTBEP annually conducts a hands-on seagrass monitoring training for local environmental scientists. Participants from a variety of agencies and organizations practice standardized methods for sampling seagrass abundance, density and health to ensure consistency in the data they collect. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) coordinates benthic monitoring of animals living on or in bay bottom sediments and chemical conditions, with participation from Manatee and Pinellas Counties. Benthic monitoring has been ongoing since 1993 with over 1500 samples analyzed. Overall, benthic conditions in the bay are considered “Fair” to “Poor” over the last 25 years, with “Good” conditions in Middle and Lower Tampa Bay in many years. There is continued need for benthic monitoring in Tampa Bay, especially in hot spots of contamination (see Action COC-1). Other recommendations include expanding laboratory analysis of sediment contaminants to include new or emerging compounds which may impact benthic habitats, such as microplastics, PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (see Action COC-4), and increasing monitoring efforts in the major river systems and minor tidal tributaries (see Action BH-9).\nCoastal marshes and mangrove forests have been mapped and quantified using traditional photointerpretation techniques, allowing restoration targets to be established. However, new approaches and techniques to capture large- and small-scale changes are required, especially for understanding and mitigating the effects of climate change. Several new monitoring techniques designed to detect small-scale changes resulting from climate change and sea level rise (SLR) are being tested and compared for effectiveness and cost-saving as part of the Critical Coastal Habitat Assessment initiated in 2014 (see Action CC-1). Large-scale habitat changes could be detected using new automated digital aerial or satellite imagery processing techniques currently in development. If these techniques prove to be accurate, precise and cost-effective, high resolution aerial imagery currently being collected by SWFWMD could yield detailed habitat maps. Combined with digital elevation data, they could help assess the fate of low-lying areas and identify opportunities to restore or purchase land so habitats can migrate landward in response to SLR.\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term monitoring sites for the Critical Coastal Habitat Assessment.\n\n\n\n\nChanges in freshwater wetland habitat were mapped for the entire Tampa Bay watershed using land cover map products derived from aerial imagery taken in 1950 and 2020. Maps were analyzed to compare the change in quantity and quality of wetland habitat over time. These data were used to help set restoration and protection targets in the Habitat Master Plan (2020 Update) (see Action BH-1).\nIn the Tampa Bay watershed, coastal uplands are important buffers between sensitive tidal wetlands and urban and agricultural development. Ongoing mapping of coastal upland habitats is necessary to assess development pressures and update targets and goals. A comprehensive mapping program for invasive plants does not exist, although various agencies maintain some location-specific information about invasive plants on their environmental lands. These local data could be augmented via citizen science using mobile devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",

Evaluate the ecological effects of MFLs on rivers and lakes in the watershed. Assess changes in freshwater inflows over time resulting from both consumptive water use and climate change.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. MFLs have been established and adopted for the Hillsborough River, Alafia River and Tampa Bypass Canal.

The Little Manatee River MFL is scheduled to be adopted in 2023. The Lower Hillsborough River minimum flow is currently managed under a recovery strategy with augmented flow from Sulphur Springs and the Tampa Bypass Canal.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nMaintaining minimum seasonal freshwater flows and levels (MFLs) in rivers in the Tampa Bay watershed helps maintain the critical hydro-biological habitat characteristics of the estuary. River water volume and flow rates govern depth, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH, and water temperature, which in turn sustain biological communities. The timing and volume of freshwater inflow is also critical to enhancing ecosystem services of tidal tributaries, especially as essential fish habitat (see Action BH-9).\n\n\n\nAlderman’s Ford on the Alafia River. The volume and timing of freshwater flows in the tidal stretches of rivers is essential to the ecology of the estuary. The tea-colored waters carry a rich soup of organic material to the lower river and bay. SOURCE: SWFWMD\n\n\nState legislation enacted in 1996 directs Water Management Districts to set MFLs for rivers, lakes and springs that define the limits at which further withdrawals would be “significantly harmful to the water resources or ecology of the area.” MFLs are used in the Districts’ water supply planning, water use permitting and environmental resource permitting programs to ensure that withdrawals do not cause environmental harm. Each District takes into account timing and volume of freshwater inflows as well as minimum flows when developing MFLs. Regional water supply development and water reuse plans reflect the challenges of balancing water supply, wastewater disposal and ecological concerns (see Action WW-1).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMinimum flows and levels, or MFLs, are the lowest water flows and water levels that can occur in a water body without doing significant harm to the water resources or ecology of the area.\n\n\nThe Southwest Florida Water Management District (SWFWMD) collects and analyzes a variety of data and seeks reviews from independent scientists and citizens on proposed MFLs and methods used to derive them. At the request of SWFWMD and Tampa Bay Water, the Tampa Bay Estuary Program (TBEP) convened workshops to obtain input from the bay management community on recommended MFLs for the Hillsborough River and the Alafia River.\nSWFWMD has established MFLs for the Hillsborough River, Alafia River, Tampa Bypass Canal and for the upper portions of the Braden River. MFLs for the Manatee River and lower Braden River have been delayed and are no longer included in the SWFWMD MFLs Priority List and Schedule (2023). Little Manatee River is scheduled for MFL adoption in 2023. A Morris Bridge Sink water reservation has been adopted to contribute to the Lower Hillsborough River MFL. MFLs are re-evaluated as needed, depending on monitoring data and anticipated or changing environmental conditions. SWFWMD has begun incorporating climate change projections into MFL models using U.S. Army Corps of Engineers 20-year scenarios.\n\n\n\nManaged freshwater discharges to the Hillsborough River just below the dam. SOURCE: SWFWMD\n\n\nMinimum flows are continuously monitored at multiple locations on most rivers by SWFWMD and the U.S. Geological Survey through gauge stations that measure flow rates and conductivity. If actual flows are or anticipated to be (within 20 years) below established minimum flows, state law requires the Water Management Districts to develop a recovery or prevention strategy. Strategies might include alternative supply development, conservation measures, augmentation of flows or reductions in permitted withdrawals. Additional monitoring specific to the recovery strategy is usually required; for example, for water quality variables including nutrients and dissolved oxygen or biological communities. Other data are collected by SWFWMD and local partners as needs and opportunities arise. TBEP facilitates development of estimated baywide hydrologic freshwater flow and nutrient loads every five years, as an element of the Tampa Bay Reasonable Assurance document.\nEstablished minimum flows are being met for Crystal Springs, Upper Hillsborough River, Alafia River (including Lithia and Buckhorn Springs), Tampa Bypass Canal and upper Braden River. A 2023 assessment indicated minimum flow requirements for the Lower Hillsborough River were met most of the time throughout the 5-year assessment period, with full achievement of minimum flows in 2023. Water from Sulphur Springs and the Tampa Bypass Canal has been used to supplement flows on the Lower Hillsborough since 2007-2008.

    "text": "Achieve a sustainable bay scallop population\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nAchieve a stable, sustainable population of bay scallops in Tampa Bay.\n\n\nSTATUS:\nOngoing. Goal revised to reflect the need to achieve sustainable scallop population rather than population sufficient for recreational harvest. Action also revised to identify additional living resource indicators of seagrass health. Action continues support for collaborative research and scallop restoration and support for citizen monitoring through the Great bay Scallop Search.\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nScallops are a key indicator of the bay’s health because of their reliance on clear waters and robust seagrasses. Collection and consumption of scallops is a cherished and popular summer pastime enjoyed by thousands of Floridians each year in nearshore waters north of Anclote Key Lighthouse in Pasco County to the Big Bend area where recreational scallop harvests are permitted.\n\n\n\nA bay scallop hides in seagrass in lower Tampa Bay. SOURCE: Nanette O’Hara\n\n\nThe goal of restoring scallops to sufficient numbers to support a recreational harvest in Tampa Bay remains as elusive as the secretive bivalves themselves. Despite dramatically improved water quality, expanding seagrasses and nearly two decades of research and recovery efforts, scallops in Tampa Bay have not yet returned to healthy, sustainable levels.\nScallops disappeared from Tampa Bay in the 1960s, a likely casualty of both declining water quality and overfishing. Efforts to restore scallop populations began in the mid-1990s, including work to rear them in hatcheries and release them in protected cages to spawn in the bay. As of 2023, recreational harvests remain closed.\nIn 1996, TBEP and Tampa Bay Watch partnered to create the Great Bay Scallop Search, a one-day event that enlists volunteers to snorkel grass beds in the lower bay looking for scallops. In 2023, the Scallop Search was expanded to Middle Tampa Bay up to Weedon Island. In the early 2000s, the number of scallops dropped into the teens. In 2007, Scallop Search volunteers tallied 555 scallops during the event, followed by 624 in 2008 and a record 674 in 2009. These positive tallies fueled continued research and monitoring efforts. However, in subsequent years, counts dropped again. TBEP’s Scallop Search Dashboard tracks the counts.\n\n\n\n\n\nScallop search counts since 1996. SOURCE: TBEP\n\n\n\n\nBay scallops are extremely sensitive to changes in water clarity, salinity, temperature and red tide. Their limited life span of only 12-18 months complicates efforts to revive populations in the bay. Additionally, only one egg out of the 12 million or so produced by a single adult scallop may survive. Moreover, new research indicates that the success of scallop recruitment here may depend upon successful dispersal of larvae from important “source sites” in the Big Bend area of Florida, where scallops are most abundant, but harvest pressure is intense. Ocean acidification associated with climate change also may affect the future health of bay scallops and other mollusks by impairing their ability to form hard, calcified shells.\nScientists continue to survey scallop populations in Tampa Bay as part of a coordinated monitoring effort throughout Southwest Florida and to investigate innovative ways to improve spawning success and larval survival. A new restoration approach that encompasses all life-stages is being applied by scientists from Mote Marine Laboratory, the Sarasota Bay Estuary Program, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and volunteers with Sarasota Bay Watch. The team is testing several techniques to boost scallop populations. One method deploys scallop collectors made from mesh produce bags that give larvae an inviting place to settle. On another, adult scallops housed together in protective cages are temporarily located in seagrass beds during their spawning period. In some trials, larvae are raised to the juvenile stage then released into seagrass beds. TBEP funded research by University of Florida found no relationship between the density of larval release on successful recruitment (Tuckett, Patterson, and Thomas 2021). Microsatellite DNA markers were identified for hatchery reared scallops that will inform effectiveness of future bay scallop restoration.\n\nTuckett, Q., J. Patterson, and S. Thomas. 2021. “Can Bay Scallop Recruitment Limitation in Tampa Bay Be Overcome Using a Targeted and Intensive Approach?” 15-21. St. Petersburg, Florida: Tampa Bay Estuary Program. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OwZpkZUf0oNJ8pkW_Pvfgg8tnB9tUSYR/view?usp=sharing.\n\n\n\nSurveys conducted annually by state biologists provide important data about scallop abundance. SOURCE: FWC\n\n\nIn the next decade, it is unlikely that scallop populations in Tampa Bay will rebound to levels sufficient to support a recreational harvest season. Therefore, this action proposes a revised goal of restoring scallop stocks to a self-sustaining level, with enough adults surviving to spawn each year to create a stable population so larval seeding efforts may one day no longer be necessary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAction Plans\nClean Waters and Sediments\nThriving Habitats and Abundant Wildlife\nInformed, Engaged, and Responsible Communities\n\n\n\nStrategies\nStrategic Plan\nResearch Priorities\nMonitoring and Indicators Plan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContact Us\n\n\nOur Mission",
